	"transcript": "[ Silence ]\n\nI think a developer would look like a geek.\n\nNerdy, plaid.\n\nUnshaven, glasses.\n\nSpikey hair, beard.\n\nA guy behind a door, that's got enough\n\nof a crack they can slide a pizza underneath.\n\nI think you won't even know who a developer is.\n\nI think you'd be surprised.\n\nI really don't know what a developer looks like,\n\nbut the apps they make let us do amazing things.\n\n[Background Music] You can talk about a project,\n\nyou can articulate it rationally,\n\nbut you cannot communicate architectural ideas\n\nwithout a drawing.\n\nI use an App called Paper by FiftyThree.\n\nIt really provides a sense of freedom,\n\na sense of being emancipated from technology.\n\nIt allows you to communicate as if directly\n\nfrom your heart, from your soul.\n\nIt's just part of you.\n\nAnd I think that that magic is part of the app world.\n\nThe app I cannot live without is a banking app named the Zhi\n\nFu Bao.\n\nAirbnb saved my life.\n\nI talk to my friends.\n\nInstagram, Tumblr.\n\nLike blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nEvernote.\n\nThat's the one.\n\nI'm addicted to Pinterest because it is amazing.\n\nThere's so much entertainment.\n\nDuck face.\n\nIt's limitless what you can do.\n\n[Background Music] The ocean, for me,\n\nis the lungs of our planet.\n\nThe health of the ocean is absolutely essential\n\nto the health of us as human beings.\n\nPangaea runs a sailing expedition vessel\n\nto help scientists collect data\n\non marine debris all around the world.\n\nThere's a variety of apps that I use everyday, iNavX is essential\n\nfor us to be able to navigate the vessel.\n\nMarine Debris Tracker allows you to enter the marine debris\n\nthat you find into a global database, so we can start\n\nto build up a bigger picture of this problem around the world.\n\nI think these apps are essential for us to be able\n\nto bring change to what's going on in the ocean.\n\nThe best app of all time has to be Tinder.\n\nI'm most probably like the millions\n\nof people that's got sucked into Candy Crush.\n\nRobot Unicorn Attack 2.\n\nCrazy girl looking to meet new people in London.\n\nInteresting.\n\nWords With Friends, Scrabble.\n\nI play Solitaire and of course I always win.\n\n[Background Music] We are stewards\n\nof dreams and hope for hitters.\n\nThey come in and they want\n\nto achieve amazing things and that's my job.\n\nDartfish has just made my life so much easier.\n\nI'm able to break down the swing into parts, so that you can see,\n\nOK, here's the mistake\n\nand here's the adjustment that I need to make.\n\nSo, what you have is a kid that can not only do it right,\n\nbut then you can train him on doing it over and over and over.\n\nNow they're able to look and say,\n\n\"You know what, I'm getting better.\"\n\nAnd that's one of the things that you need for life\n\nin general, but in sports you want hope.\n\nAnd so now it's easy for them to focus on dreaming.\n\n[ Noise ]\n\nWe need like a silence finder app.\n\nPop, pop, pop, pop.\n\nPop, pop, pop.\n\nI gravitate towards very melancholy and painful songs.\n\n[Singing] Ahhh.\n\nAnd then it's time to turn the page, whoop.\n\nThis has become as essential as my guitar.\n\nThere are apps that help people, that like,\n\nreally improve people's lives.\n\n[Background Music] Every now and then I'll sort of stare\n\nat the hand, with the sense of sort of wonder going, \"Wow.\"\n\nIt is like magic, it really is.\n\nIn combination with the hand the app has allowed me\n\nto gain functionality and independence.\n\nI enjoy being known as the kid with the bionic arm.\n\nYou know, it's something interesting,\n\nand it's something different,\n\nand I'm a big fan of being different.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nYou open up an app and you open up a possibility\n\nand a whole world is being born.\n\nWhat we really have is an intersection\n\nbetween technology and art.\n\nYou see the world in a different way and I think an app can do\n\nthat because it really does open something you didn't\n\nknow beforehand.\n\nDevelopers are doing extraordinary things.\n\nI can't believe what they're creating today, it's genius.\n\nIf I met the person that made Sky Go,\n\nI'd probably give him a massive hug.\n\nYou inspire me so much.\n\nThey make our lives better and they think of things that,\n\nobviously, regular people can't think of.\n\nI don't know how the technology works,\n\nit's just magic to me.\n\nThere's no question they are changing the world.\n\nSo, to everyone who's made any apps\n\nthat I've ever enjoyed I say, \"Thank you.\"\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nGood morning.\n\nWelcome to San Francisco.\n\nWe're here today and all week\n\nto celebrate the developer community and all\n\nof the amazing apps that they've created.\n\nI hope that video did a great job\n\nof capturing just how deeply we feel\n\nabout out developer community and more importantly the number\n\nof lives they've enriched.\n\nSo from all of Apple, thank you very much.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThis is a milestone year for this conference.\n\nIt's the 25th anniversary of the conference.\n\nIt started in 1990 with just 1,300 developers, who gathered\n\nto talk about the System 7.\n\nAnd there was one lab in that developer conference.\n\nNow, WWDC is a huge conference for Apple and a huge conference\n\nfor all of our developers.\n\nWe have over a thousand of our best\n\nand brightest engineers here today to talk with you directly\n\nin labs, about how to improve your code.\n\nWe've got people from more countries than ever before,\n\nand two-thirds of the attendees today are here\n\nat a developer's conference for the very first time.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nA special shout-out this morning\n\nto the student scholarship winners.\n\nThey worked really hard to get here.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOur youngest developer in the audience today is 13.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nWe're going to be seeing apps from them for a long time.\n\nThe developer community is incredibly vibrant.\n\nWe now have 9 million registered developers.\n\nThat's up almost 50 percent since last year.\n\nThat's the most developers we've ever added in a single year.\n\nNow, this morning, we're gathered to talk\n\nabout two powerful platforms, OS X and iOS.\n\nAnd you are going to see some great new features for both,\n\nand some great updates.\n\nBut even more importantly, you're going\n\nto see how they've been engineered\n\nto work seamlessly together.\n\nNow, you're also going to see the mother\n\nof all releases for developers.\n\nIt's a huge release and it's so huge\n\nthat we've dedicated an entire section\n\nof the presentation just for this.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, let's get started with OS X and the Mac.\n\nWe're shipping the best Macs in our history.\n\nIf you look just in this last fiscal year,\n\nwhile the industry declined by 5 percent Macs grew by 12 percent,\n\nthat's swelled our installed base of Macs to over 80 million,\n\nwhich is a record for us.\n\nWe're really proud of this.\n\nAnd of course our latest release\n\nof OS X Mavericks has done really great.\n\nIt had great features for power users like power tabs, and tags,\n\nand enhanced support for multiple displays.\n\nAdvanced technologies for longer battery life\n\nand greater performance.\n\nAnd of course, new and improved apps.\n\nJust since its release in October we've installed\n\nover 40 million copies of Mavericks.\n\nThis is the most of a single release ever in Apple's history.\n\nAlso, that makes over 50 percent of our installed base working\n\non our latest operating system.\n\nThis is the fastest adoption ever\n\nof any PC operating system in history.\n\nNow, you may wonder how that compares to Windows.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nI knew somebody was going to ask so I decided to make a chart.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nWell, as it turns out Windows 8 shipped\n\nabout a year before Mavericks and it's at 14 percent.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nNeed I say more?\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, we could not be happier with Mavericks and the momentum\n\nof the Mac, but of course we're always future focused.\n\nAnd today, to talk about the future of OS X,\n\nI'd like to invite my colleague up, Craig Federighi,\n\nto tell us all about it.\n\nCraig.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nGood morning.\n\nWow.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nWell, it's wonderful to be here presenting among the greatest\n\ndevelopers collected in the world.\n\nYou guys are fantastic.\n\nYou know, it was just a year ago, here at WWDC,\n\nwhen we narrowly averted a major OS X naming crisis.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nYou may remember that we're able to deftly shift from names based\n\non big cats to names based on beautiful places in California,\n\nstarting of course with OS X Mavericks.\n\nWell, it's another year and time for another name\n\nand so we collected our crack product marketing team,\n\nshoved them in their VW Minibus and set them out on the road.\n\nNow, they first ventured south discovering OS X, Oxnard.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nThis wasn't quite right.\n\nBut undeterred, they headed east,\n\nlanded in OS X Rancho Cucamonga.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nStill, we hadn't quite hit the mark.\n\nSo, they boldly ventured north landing at OS X Weed.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nNow\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nStrangely, this one had large pockets of support\n\nwithin the product marketing organization,\n\nbut saner heads did prevail and they set off\n\non what then was somewhat more circuitous path.\n\nIt took them ultimately to a place\n\nthat embodies the beauty and power of OS X.\n\nWe discovered OS X Yosemite.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, Yosemite is a fantastic new release with a new interface,\n\nbig enhancements to our most popular apps\n\nand something all knew, we call Continuity.\n\nNow, I want to start with design.\n\nOS X, of course started with the bold design of Aqua.\n\nAnd over the years, it's evolved\n\nto the refined look we all loved today in Mavericks.\n\nWell, with Yosemite, we continue this evolution and I'd\n\nlike to give you a look at where we're headed.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nHow about that?\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nI think the team has done some remarkable work.\n\nYou know, we started with the most fundamental controls,\n\nfocused always on clarity, as well as utility.\n\nWe refined the tool bars and the window materials\n\nand the window constructions.\n\nIf you look at the window title bar, you'll see how the use\n\nof translucent materials gives you a sense of place\n\nas you scroll your content.\n\nNow, these same carefully crafted translucent materials\n\nare used in the sidebars.\n\nSo now, your windows take on the personality of your desktop.\n\nAs you change your desktop picture, your window adapts\n\nto reflect that personality and that temperature.\n\nAnd the translucency also helps maintain a sense of depth\n\nand place as you move your windows over one another.\n\nNow, we also use the same gorgeous translucent material\n\nfor the dock and check out these beautifully crafted new icons.\n\nSo clean and yet so fundamentally still Mac.\n\nAnd check out the trash can, that is a gorgeous trash can.\n\nYou wouldn't believe how much time we spent crafting a\n\ntrash can.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nSo, we also focused on precise\n\nand consistent typography throughout.\n\nSo, from the menus to the window chrome\n\nto application control is consistent and clear type.\n\nNow, we know, for our pro users, often, they really want to focus\n\non the center on the screen and not be distracted\n\nby bright menus and bright docks,\n\nso we also introduced a dark mode.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nLovers of dark.\n\nYes. So, of course these changes extend\n\nthrough to the applications.\n\nYou notice here, with Calendar, this construction\n\nwith a common toolbar and title bar area\n\nthat makes the window both more distinctly recognizable,\n\nbut more importantly maximizes the space available for content.\n\nAnd we carry this\n\nover throughout the system to apps like Maps.\n\nNow, we also have a new look for sidebar apps, like Messages,\n\nyou can see it here with the beautiful translucent material\n\nrunning top to bottom.\n\nAnd we extend that look to apps like FaceTime,\n\nContacts, and Reminders.\n\nAll in all they come together for a gorgeous\n\nand more usable version of OS X, the best ever.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext, let's talk about Notification Center.\n\nNotification Center on OS X, of course,\n\nadopts the dark translucent material\n\nand precise type of Yosemite.\n\nIt also now, most importantly, has a new Today view.\n\nSo, you get an at-a-glance look at your Calendar,\n\nyour Reminders, Weather, and more, but most importantly,\n\nyou can extend the contents of Today view with the contents\n\nof widgets and apps that you've downloaded from the App Store.\n\nJust add them right in and set up the Today view, that you want\n\nfor at-a-glance access to information.\n\nAnd that is Notification Center.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext up. Spotlight.\n\nSo Spotlight has always been a superfast way\n\nto launch applications and find content local on your Mac.\n\nAnd Yosemite is a great new interface.\n\nSo when you click on the magnifying glass\n\non the toolbar you'll get a big field right\n\nin the middle of the display.\n\nAnd if you just type a few characters,\n\nyou can launch an app just like that, or type the name\n\nof a document and you get great search results\n\nand an inline preview, it's really awesome.\n\nNow, in addition to these sources, local to your Mac,\n\nwe also tap into sources of information on the internet.\n\nSo for instance, type a few characters in like Yosemite,\n\nyou can get news feed, information from Wikipedia,\n\nand even maps all at your finger tips.\n\nI'd like to give you a quick demo\n\nof the new UI in Yosemite now.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAll right.\n\nSo here is our first look at Yosemite live.\n\nSo we see our beautiful new typography in our menus,\n\nthis gorgeous new dock and these beautiful icons.\n\nLet's launch an app.\n\nI'm going to start here with Maps and I want you to observe\n\nthat as I scroll the content of the map,\n\nthe way that the title bar actually reacts its translucency\n\nand color to the content beneath is just really gorgeous.\n\nI'm going to launch now another app.\n\nCalendar. So Calendar has a new look for a week view\n\nbut also an all new day view.\n\nAnd you notice here on day view, I have all of my meetings\n\nin the day right here on the left,\n\nand on the right I got details about my appointments.\n\nSo for instance, here at 2 o'clock,\n\nwe have our executive karaoke outing,\n\nthat's going to be big blast.\n\nIt's right there.\n\nYou want to probably drop in on that if you get the chance.\n\nSo let's take a look now at Messages.\n\nSo Messages, you see this use\n\nof the translucent sidebar material, how it reacts subtly\n\nto the background is really nice, and how the contents\n\nof the title bar react as I scroll content underneath.\n\nIt's really cool.\n\nLet's take a look at Notification Center.\n\nSo of course, I have my notifications here,\n\nbut I also have Today view so I can see my Calendar\n\nat a glance, my Weather.\n\nThese are interactive so I can click, get hourly weather,\n\nclock, interact with stocks for instance, or even Reminders.\n\nSo here I'm supposed to practice for the demo and I forgot to do\n\nthat but it's too late now.\n\nSo, we'll send out one on its way.\n\nNow, of course, I can edit these widgets as well,\n\njust click the Edit button down here\n\nand you see widgets available to me right here on the side.\n\nThese are all from apps that can export widgets.\n\nSo I'm just going to drag out Calculator,\n\nadd that in here just like that or even a third party widget.\n\nLet's drag one of those in, ESPN SportsCenter.\n\nSo right there, I get all my information right at a glance.\n\nIt's really awesome.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo next. Spotlight.\n\nSo I'm going to click here on the magnifying glass and, boom,\n\ngot a search field right in the middle of the screen.\n\nI can type just a couple of characters to launch an app\n\nlike our new reminders.\n\nThere it is.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nBut of course, Spotlight is great for looking up people too.\n\nSo I'm going to look up Phil Schiller here.\n\nThere's Phil.\n\nAnd you see I have all of his contact information here,\n\nbut I also have matches on mail from Phil.\n\nPhil and I are planning a camping trip.\n\nHe's a bit of a gear nut and has something he wants\n\nto try out on our trip.\n\nWe also have Events and Reminders.\n\nSo we have here that our Meeting at the Campsite and oh, good.\n\nI see that Jeff and Johnny are both in on the trip as well.\n\nAnd I'll tell you, you just have not had chili by the campfire\n\nuntil you've eaten it with one\n\nof Johnny's custom crafted aluminium spoons.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nIt's a it's the diamond cut chamfered edges\n\nthat really make the experience.\n\nSo, I'm working on a document as well to help plan our trip.\n\nNow, there are a lot of ways of course to find documents,\n\nbut one way now is by app.\n\nSo this is a numbers document.\n\nI typed numbers and you see in addition to the app,\n\nI get all my recent documents that I've opened with that app\n\nand I can access them right here.\n\nSo let's open up my hiking trip.\n\nAnd here we see that the trip has planned involved a 16.4 mile\n\nhike and you're being an operations professional.\n\nJeff is a big stickler for the metric system.\n\nAnd so, fortunately, Spotlight has my back.\n\nI can just type in 16.4 miles here\n\nand I get an instant conversion to kilometers.\n\nSo that's awfully handy.\n\nWe do all kinds of conversion.\n\nThey drop that in, fix that document right up.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAll right.\n\nWell, that's enough for my document.\n\nI can also do great searches like just type a few characters,\n\nbang, I've got Yosemite entry from Wikipedia.\n\nI've got news from various sources.\n\nI even have maps right here.\n\nWell, you know, I'm looking to plan a dinner and maybe a movie\n\nout and now without even launching an app,\n\nI can just do a look up for sushi for instance.\n\nAnd we see I have maps results right here,\n\nright inside of Spotlight.\n\nAnd of course, in addition to map information,\n\nwe've got pictures, great information\n\nfrom Yelp, it's all right there.\n\nAnd to wrap it up, I want to go out to a movie.\n\nYou can just type in Godzilla here.\n\nOh, there we go, Godzilla.\n\nAnd you see, I have show times\n\nwhere it's playing near me right here in Spotlight as well\n\nas content I can stream from the iTunes Store, all in Spotlight.\n\nThat's a quick look at the new UI of Yosemite.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo next, iCloud Drive.\n\nNow OK, intriguing.\n\nSo, we all know that documents in the Cloud,\n\nprovides a really convenient way for working with an app\n\nthat works across all platforms working on the same document.\n\nBut now with iCloud Drive,\n\nyour Mac in addition will let you work on those\n\nwithin the document has,\n\nall of those folders right accessible inside of Finder.\n\nAnd in addition to those apps that are local\n\nto your Mac you can get a content from apps\n\nthat you don't have on your Mac,\n\nso get a contents from iOS documents.\n\nBut even better, you can store all of your own files\n\nof any sort and organize them however you wish with folders\n\nand tags and they're synchronized automatically\n\nacross all your Macs.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd all of this content is also accessible\n\nfrom your iOS devices via the iCloud document picker right\n\nin app.\n\nAnd what the heck we're throwing in Windows, too.\n\n[ Laughter &amp; Applause ]\n\nNext up. Mail.\n\nSo, Mail in Yosemite has an elegant new Yosemite style UI.\n\nBut we really focused on the basics,\n\nreliable synching fast switching between mailboxes, quick fetches\n\nof your new mail, the basics.\n\nBut in addition to that, we want to address a fundamental problem\n\nwith email, which is these days we so often want\n\nto send large attachments whether it's videos\n\nor large sets of photos and we're underpinning one of these,\n\na message saying that our recipient's mail server can't\n\ntake those large attachments.\n\nWell, we're solving that problem\n\nwith the technology we call Mail Drop.\n\nWith Mail Drop, instead of your message bouncing off your\n\nrecipient's mail server, you can elect\n\nto have the attachment sent encrypted\n\nand securely via iCloud separate from the message\n\nand it rendezvous on the receiving end.\n\nSo, if your recipient has a Mac, they get it just like before.\n\nAnd if they have another client, they get a link\n\nto securely download those attachments.\n\nAnd those attachments can be up to 5 gigs in size.\n\nThat's Mail Drop\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo next. Markup.\n\nHave you ever been working on an email message and you realized\n\nthat if you could just maybe circle something\n\nor write something on the message,\n\nmaybe do a little something, you can get your point\n\nacross so much more clearly, well, now with Markup you can.\n\nIt burns right back in to your mail message,\n\nand it even works with PDFs.\n\nSo if you needed, for instance, sign a PDF, you can now do\n\nthat with your iSight camera\n\nor even drawing your signature right on the trackpad\n\nand it goes right into the email message\n\nand you can send on its way.\n\nIt's going to be super handy.\n\nNext. Great.\n\nI love it.\n\nNext up. Safari.\n\nWe've in Yosemite been able to pack all the power\n\nof the Safari UI into this single bar,\n\nand that means you have more space for your content.\n\nNow, of course, you may wonder what happened\n\non my Favorites bar.\n\nWell, of course, you can bring that back if you want to.\n\nBut in Yosemite you don't really need\n\nto because now your Smart Search Field\n\nwhen you click it shows you all of your favorites right there.\n\nAnd it's also really great for search.\n\nSo in addition, when you type to get\n\nin your smart search suggestions,\n\nyou also get spotlight suggestions right there\n\nin your completion menu.\n\nAnd this means, you can get things faster than ever before.\n\nNow, Safari is also more powerful than ever with sharing.\n\nSo now, if you want to subscribe to an RSS feed on the site,\n\nyou can do that right here\n\nand those RSS feed articles will show up right\n\nin your Safari sidebar under Shared Links.\n\nAnd you can also share to people more quickly than ever,\n\nbecause Safari lists the people you've message\n\nwith most recently, and with just one click you can share\n\na webpage.\n\nNow, Safari is better than ever as well with tabs.\n\nWe now have a tab view that gives you a bird's-eye glance\n\nof all of your tabs and it stacks tabs from sites just\n\nlike this so you get individual stacks\n\nfor each site that you're browsing.\n\nSafari is also great when it comes to privacy.\n\nSafari was the first browser to introduce private browsing\n\nand now it's easier than ever,\n\nbecause you can create a new private window.\n\nAnd when you do, all the content within that window\n\nand all its tabs stay private and all\n\nof your other windows are unaffected.\n\nIt's really handy.\n\nNow, Safari is great when it comes to standards.\n\nIt has WebGL now for superfast 3D graphics,\n\nSPDY for efficient networking, and HTML Premium Video.\n\nNow, this enables modern Macs to efficiently stream video\n\nfrom site like Netflix without a plug-in\n\nand the results are awesome.\n\nYou get up to two hours longer battery life\n\non a MacBook Air streaming Netflix.\n\nAnd that's for 1080P video.\n\nNow, Safari has been set the benchmark really\n\nfor energy efficiency since Mavericks\n\nand its lead here continues.\n\nWhen it comes to multi-tab browser energy efficiency,\n\nSafari is without equal.\n\nAnd when it comes to the kind of UI manipulations\n\nthat are typical in web apps, Safari is faster than ever.\n\nAnd how about JavaScript?\n\nWell, take the most complex kind of JavaScript that's typical\n\nof very rich web applications.\n\nWell, Safari now has a Fourth Tier LLVM-based optimized\n\nJavaScript Compiler that is the fastest of any major browser.\n\nAnd when it comes to typical website JavaScript,\n\nSafari is in a league of its own.\n\nSo of that is Safari.\n\nAnd to give you a quick demo, I'd like to bring\n\nup Brian Crowe to the stage.\n\nLet's give him a big welcome.\n\nBrian.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThanks Craig.\n\nI'm really happy to be here today.\n\nSo, I'm just going to dive right into Safari.\n\nHere we go.\n\nIt's really great.\n\nAnd when you go to a website,\n\nyou can really appreciate the new design.\n\nIt's simpler and it's even more powerful.\n\nI can open up the sidebar really easily to get at my Bookmarks,\n\nmy Reading List as well as my Shared Links.\n\nAnd when I click into the Search field, I get instant access\n\nto all my favorite sites.\n\nIt's really nice.\n\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and type\n\nin a search for Ansel Adams.\n\nThere we go.\n\nAnd if I hit return, I can just go\n\nto a regular old Google search.\n\nBut, since Ansel Adams is a common search term,\n\nI get this new Spotlight suggestion there at the top.\n\nIt has a snippet of information from Wikipedia.\n\nI can read it there, or if I'd like I can go ahead\n\nand see the entire article right on the Wikipedia site.\n\nIt's super convenient.\n\nNow, if you use tabs, you're going to love this.\n\nNow, no matter how many tabs I have opened,\n\nI can smoothly scroll through them to get at any\n\nof that tab I'm looking for.\n\nIt's really nice.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo now, sometimes I want to see my tabs so I can go ahead\n\nand do this and I'll click on the new Tab View button.\n\nAnd there you go, a beautiful bird's eye view\n\nof all my open tabs.\n\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and select this one here.\n\nIt's a photoblog with a bunch of pictures of Yosemite\n\nand there's a couple of good ones of El Capitan down below.\n\nSo, I'll find in there El Capitan.\n\nAnd then I'm going to choose this one.\n\nNow, I want to share it with Craig so I'm going\n\nto get the high-res image.\n\nNow, sharing couldn't be easier in Safari.\n\nI just simply click on the Share button here,\n\nand now I can use the new recent recipients feature\n\nto address it to Craig.\n\nAnd here we go.\n\nAnd with just one click, I'm ready to send that image.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nSo But before I send it,\n\nI'm going to add my two cents to this.\n\nSo, I can go here and we have just the right feature\n\ncalled Markup.\n\nNow with Markup, I can edit this image\n\nwithout ever even leaving Mail.\n\nIt's really great.\n\nSo, what I'm going to do is annotate this image\n\nwith a nice magnifying glass a loop.\n\nSo, you move it around you can say\n\nthat it magnifies everything underneath it.\n\nSo, I'm going to place it right here.\n\nAnd it turns out that those two specs\n\non the big granite face there, they're actually climbers.\n\nIt's kind of crazy.\n\nSo, I'm going to zoom it a little more\n\nso you can see it better.\n\nThere we go.\n\nSo, I can zoom nicely and place it here.\n\nNow, I want to point this out to Craig in the mail.\n\nAnd I can use my trackpad to draw on the image.\n\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and draw an arrow here.\n\nThere we go.\n\nAnd you notice Markup's smart enough to recognize the arrow\n\nand make it really pretty.\n\nSo now now, it's really easy to add a comment.\n\nAnd so, check out the climbers.\n\nThere we go.\n\nNow, I can have a little fun with this, so I'm going\n\nto go ahead and create a cartoon bubble, OK?\n\nI'm not so good at drawing but Markup's going to help me.\n\nThere we go.\n\nSo, luckily you can clean that up [phonetic],\n\nit's better than I am.\n\nSo now I can add a caption.\n\nAnd so, I think I'm going to appeal\n\nto the inner developer and all of us.\n\nI'm going to type in \"I hope the rope is,\"\n\nwait for it, \"multithreaded.\"\n\nYeah.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nOK. So, I think I've done enough to this picture.\n\nTime to go.\n\nSo, now it's ready for me to mail\n\nand I can just click like that.\n\nSo that's how easy it is to Markup an image in Mail.\n\nSo, those are just a couple\n\nof great new features in Safari in Mail.\n\nThank you.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nHow about that parallel programming joke.\n\nYou did not see that coming.\n\nNext, something entirely different.\n\nIt's called the Continuity.\n\nSo now at Apple, we believe you should be able\n\nto use the right device for the moment.\n\nMaybe your phone when you're on the go, your iPad when you want\n\nto kick back on the couch, or maybe your Mac\n\nwhen you're trying to get some work done.\n\nBut we also want the transitions between these moments\n\nto be absolutely as natural and seamless as possible.\n\nNow, our Continuity features start with something simple\n\nand that's AirDrop, because now AirDrop works\n\nbetween iOS and the Mac.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nIt's really convenient.\n\nBut now we have something that we really take it\n\nto the next level and that's called Handoff.\n\nSo, it turns out now that when you're working on your Mac,\n\nyour devices around you in proximity are aware\n\nof each other and aware of what you're up to.\n\nAnd so, if you want to pick up where you left off on your Mac\n\nand your iPad, your iPad is prompting you right\n\nin the lower left of the screen.\n\nJust swipe up and you can pick up working\n\non what you're working on your Mac right on your iPad.\n\nAnd this\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThis works in the other direction as well.\n\nSo, let's say, you're composing an email on your phone\n\nand you walk up to your Mac.\n\nWell, your Mac will notice what you're doing\n\nand prompt you right on the dock.\n\nYou click it and you can pick up finishing\n\nthat message right on your Mac.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, we've been able to take this same proximity awareness\n\nand make the process of creating a hotspot easier\n\nthan ever before.\n\nSo now, if you're using your Mac and you're away from a network\n\nbut your phone is nearby, when you go up to your Wi-Fi menu,\n\nyour Mac, actually without any configuration ever have been\n\ndone on your phone, sees your phone and prompts you\n\nso you click it and it automatically sets up a hotspot.\n\nYou never type a password and you're\n\non the network that easily.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd this works even if your phone is\n\nacross the room sitting in a handbag.\n\nYou just never have to touch it.\n\nNow, the next that we really wanted to handle is SMS.\n\nNow, we all love iMessage.\n\nWe can continue our conversations seamlessly\n\nfrom device to device but then we have these green\n\nbubble friends.\n\nAnd, you know, they have inferior devices and they insist\n\non sending us messages, and we don't want\n\nto hold it against them.\n\nBut the problem is that those messages don't show\n\nup on our other devices until now, because now\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nyour phone is able to access or relay to automatically\n\nand transparently send your messages between devices.\n\nNow, believe it or not,\n\nwe're able to do the same thing with phone calls.\n\nSo now, when you receive a phone call,\n\nyour Mac gives you caller ID and you can even accept the call\n\nand use your Mac as a speaker phone.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd believe it or not, this works even if your phone is\n\nacross the house in a charger.\n\nYou never have to miss a call.\n\nWell, now that your Mac is all phone savvy,\n\nit's also a great way to dial the phone.\n\nSo, if you're in Contacts and you want to dial a number,\n\nyou can do it right there.\n\nAnd even on a webpage, you see a number you want to call,\n\nyou can call it right from your Mac.\n\nSo I want to give you\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo if you're up for it, I'd love to give you a demo now.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo, let's check out Continuity.\n\nAnd we're going to start with Handoff.\n\nI'm going to pick up my iPhone here.\n\nAnd I was composing an email about our karaoke night.\n\nDoes anyone want to you know, I'm by my Mac,\n\nso let's use my Mac here.\n\nAnd you notice my Mac actually is aware\n\nthat I was using my phone.\n\nSo with a click, I bring up that message\n\nto right where I left of.\n\nDoes anyone want to go and you know,\n\nto give these people some inspiration\n\nabout what they might be able to experience at karaoke night,\n\nyou just summon a picture from last year's karaoke event.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nNow, that ought to get them going.\n\nSo, I'll send that one on its way.\n\nNow, of course, this works in the other direction.\n\nOh, it looks like Andrea is up for some karaoke.\n\nAnd he sent me a URL just to a good place to go for karaoke.\n\nSo, I can pull that up here.\n\nNow, if I want to show this page to a friend,\n\nmaybe pick up my iPad, you notice as I look at my iPad.\n\nLet's put that up on the screen.\n\nThere at the bottom is Safari.\n\nI just flick up and it takes me right to where I left off.\n\nIt's really amazing.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext up, phone calling.\n\nHold it one sec.\n\nWell, this is from my mom.\n\nNow, she is surely wants to grill me\n\nabout newest Fourth Tier LLVM Compiler in Safari\n\nbut this is not the right time.\n\nI know you'd all love to hear from mom but I'm going\n\nto scrape I'm sorry.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nShe's a wonderful, wonderful woman.\n\nBut that's this is my space.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nSo, but, you know, I would\n\nlike to show you how we can make phone calls.\n\nAnd so, I can dial from web pages.\n\nSo, for instance, if I wanted to go dial a phone number\n\nlike this one right here, I could just select\n\nand hit it just like this.\n\nAnd you notice I get an option\n\nto call right here inside of Safari.\n\nBut, you know, I wanted to make a phone call\n\nto a new Apple employee that's joined in.\n\nSo, it's something we do from time to time.\n\nSo, let me just bring up this.\n\nHere we go.\n\nA little welcome call?\n\nLet's give him a WWDC welcome.\n\nSo, let's have my Mac dial via my iPhone.\n\nI talk to people like him all the time of course.\n\nThis is very normal for me.\n\n[ Phone Ringing ]\n\nHello?\n\nWow. Hey, it's Craig Federighi here.\n\nHey, how are you doing?\n\nThis is Dre.\n\nHey, Doctor, you're on speaker phone with via my Mac\n\nwith over 6,000 amazing developers here at WWDC.\n\nWe all want to welcome you to Apple.\n\nHey, thanks Craig.\n\nI love a big audience.\n\nI want to thank everybody there\n\nfor creating such an amazing apps.\n\nYeah, they have created some amazing apps.\n\nBy the way, I'm glad you called.\n\nI hear Tim gets in pretty early.\n\nWhat time should I show up for work?\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nIf you want to beat Tim into the office, it'd be about 4:30.\n\nBut, I think, you know, orientation\n\nnew employee orientation starts at 9:00.\n\nSo and you don't want to miss the free t-shirts\n\nso I'd shoot for 9:00.\n\nSounds good.\n\nI can't wait to get to work with the team at Apple.\n\nWell, Dre, it's been great chatting with you.\n\nI'll see you around campus.\n\nThanks, Craig.\n\nTalk soon.\n\nAll right, bye.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd, that's continuity, so Yosemite, a beautiful new design\n\nwith notification center with the new Today view\n\nand customizable widgets, spotlight with fast search\n\nand access to all kinds of great sources of information\n\non the internet, a new iCloud Drive,\n\nmail with great new features.\n\nSafari, faster and more elegant than ever.\n\nAnd of course, continuity.\n\nIt's a wonderful new release, Yosemite.\n\nAnd it's available to you developers here today.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, everyone else will get it in the fall and believe it\n\nor not, it will be free.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, we're doing something a little unusual this summer\n\nas well which is we're having a public beta program.\n\nSo, if you're a non-developer and you want\n\nto help us improve Yosemite, you can sign up on the web\n\nand you can receive access\n\nto Yosemite betas throughout the summer.\n\nThat is OS X Yosemite.\n\nI think you're going to love it.\n\nI'm going to hand it back to Tim.\n\nThank you.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThank, Craig.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nIt's a really terrific release.\n\nI'm just glad I'm in the beta program.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nNext up is iOS.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nWe've now sold well over 800 million iOS devices and each\n\nof the categories of devices has set its own significant sales\n\nrecord in the past year.\n\niPod Touch has passed 100 million units.\n\niPad has passed 200 million units.\n\nAnd iPhone has passed half a billion units.\n\nThis is incredible.\n\nBut what's even more impressive is how many new customers\n\nto Apple that iOS devices has brought to us.\n\nOver 130 million customers who bought an iOS device\n\nin the past 12 months was buying their first Apple device.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, many of these customers were switchers from Android.\n\nThey had bought an Android phone by mistake.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nAnd then had sought a better experience and a better life.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nAnd decided to check out iPhone and iOS.\n\nNearly, in fact, nearly half of our customers in China\n\nin the past six months switched from Android to iPhone.\n\nThis is incredible and of course\n\nthat better experience is our devices in iOS.\n\nAnd iOS 7 took that experience to even higher level.\n\nThe customer sat with iOS 7 is really off the charts.\n\nChange wave recently measured it at 97 percent.\n\nThese are customer sat ratings that no one gets.\n\nIt's really enormous.\n\nNow, one of the reasons why customers say they love iOS is\n\nthat we make available our software updates\n\nfor the OS available to as many customers as possible.\n\nAnd, if you look at what has happened with iOS 7,\n\nour latest release, almost 9 out of 10 people\n\nin our install base are running our latest operating system.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, this is in stark contrast to Android.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nIf you look at their latest release, less than one out of 10\n\nof their customers are on their latest software.\n\nAnd, if you look at a broader group, over a third\n\nof their customers are running a version\n\nof Android from four years ago.\n\nThat's like ancient history.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nNow, that means that these customers are not getting great\n\nnew features.\n\nThey're not able to run your latest apps.\n\nAnd, they don't get security updates\n\nthat they may need to stay safe.\n\nAnd, this is particularly important for Android\n\nwhich dominates the mobile malware market.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nNo wonder experts are saying things like this.\n\nAndroid fragmentation is turning devices\n\ninto a toxic hell stew of vulnerabilities.\n\nNow, fortunately, iOS hasn't had this kind of issues\n\nbecause we do everything we can to make our updates available\n\nto as many people as possible.\n\nSo, we could not be happier with iOS 7\n\nand the momentum of iOS devices.\n\nBut, we are not standing still.\n\nToday, we're announcing iOS 8.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd, iOS 8 is a giant release\n\nand it's really two stories not one.\n\nIt has great end user features.\n\nBut, it also has incredible developer features\n\nso you can extend your experience and build apps\n\nthat you couldn't do before.\n\nWe'd like to get started with describing it with talking\n\nabout the end user features.\n\nAnd, to do that, I'd like to bring Craig back\n\nup to the stage.\n\nCraig?\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nI missed you guys.\n\nSo, what? Let's talk about iOS 8.\n\nNow, iOS 8 of course builds on the design of iOS 7\n\nwith enhancements for both iPhone and iPad.\n\nAnd, let's start with the phone.\n\nNow, in iOS 8, we've refined notification center.\n\nBut, what I really love are our new interactive notifications.\n\nSo now, if you get a message like this, just pull down\n\nand you can reply from right where you are.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nYou don't have to leave the app you're in.\n\nAnd this works for all kinds of notifications.\n\nIf you get a calendar event for instance, just pull down\n\nand respond and it works on the lock screen.\n\nSo, you can just swipe across in the lock screen.\n\nYou get those action buttons tapped\n\nand you've dealt with it right there.\n\nNow, in iOS 7, we gave you quick double-tap access to get\n\nat your most recent apps.\n\nWell now, you can also use that same double tap to get\n\nat the people you communicate with most frequently.\n\nIt's really handy.\n\nAnd, in iOS 7, we introduce this great Tab View in Safari.\n\nWell, we're bringing a great Tab View to iPad as well\n\nwith this bird's eye view of all of your tabs.\n\nAnd, Safari also picks up the Side Bar that we love\n\nin Yosemite with access to your bookmarks, your reading list\n\nand your shared links.\n\nNow, we've made managing your mail easier than ever before.\n\nSo now, if you're reading a message, you want to remember\n\nto get back to it so you're going to mark it on red.\n\nWe can do that with just a single gesture.\n\nAnd, if you want to flag a message,\n\nyou can just pull across, there's a flag option.\n\nBut, if you pull all the way across,\n\nyou can delete with just a gesture.\n\nBut the piece I love the best is what we've done\n\nwith composing messages.\n\nHave you ever found yourself composing an email\n\nand then you really wish like you get at something else\n\nin your inbox maybe for that reply?\n\nWell now, you can.\n\nJust swipe that message down and you have access\n\nto the rest of your mail.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, I'd like to give you a demo of some\n\nof these great iOS 8 enhancements now.\n\nSo, here we are on our iOS 8 lock screen.\n\nAnd, if I receive a notification,\n\nit looks like I happen to get one just right then,\n\nI can swipe across and you see I have action so I can accept\n\nor decline this meeting right here.\n\nAnd, of course, I'm going to use the device,\n\nif I'm in here maybe playing some music here on iTunes radio,\n\nI might get a notification.\n\nAnd, if I do get notification, I can just swipe down on it, too.\n\nSo, here's one, just swipe down.\n\nNow, I get access to my keyboard.\n\nI can type right there.\n\nNow, this works great for third party apps as well.\n\nSo, for instance, looks like I got tagged on Facebook,\n\nI can like it right here with an actionable notification.\n\nAnd, sometimes, you receive notifications\n\nthat you just really don't want deal with right now\n\nand you can just flick those away like that.\n\nThat's really handy.\n\nNow, we've made getting at people easier than ever before.\n\nSo, if I just double-tap my Home button,\n\nso I have all the people I most recently communicated with.\n\nI swipe to the side and I have access to all my favorites.\n\nIf I tap on one, I have controls here to give them a phone call,\n\niMessage them or even FaceTime right here\n\nwith just a double-tap on the Home button.\n\nIt's really handy.\n\nNow, I want to show you some\n\nof the enhancements we made to mail.\n\nLet's go take a look an iPad actually this time.\n\nSo, here we are on iPad.\n\nI'm going to launch mail.\n\nNow, I have a number of unread messages here\n\nso let's work our way through them.\n\nHere's a message from Open Table with a dinner appointment.\n\nAnd, you notice that the reservation is actually called\n\nout right here on the top.\n\nMail has actually given me an intelligent suggestion here\n\nto add it to my calendar.\n\nI can tap Add and just like this, it lets\n\nit prompts me to fill out and add an event to my calendar.\n\nThat's really handy.\n\nNow, sometimes, you get a message like this\n\nwhere you're going to have to do some thinking about it.\n\nMaybe get back to it later.\n\nWell now, with just a single swipe, I can mark it as unread.\n\nIt's really cool.\n\nYou can also flag really easily.\n\nSo, this is a message I want to flag.\n\nJust flick it across and flag.\n\nNow, here's a nice message.\n\nI don't know who this fellow is but he says great collaboration.\n\nYou and Johnny have really come together really well.\n\nLet's take a look at that one.\n\nOh, dear God.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nWell, this would be a good time\n\nto demonstrate our quick delete feature.\n\nSo, I can drag all the way across and delete at a glance.\n\nI'm certain that message won't haunt me\n\non the internet for years to come.\n\nSo, let's talk about composing.\n\nI got a message here from a friend who's visiting in town,\n\nwho's looking for a good restaurant.\n\nSo, I'll start replying to this message.\n\nAnd, I'll say, let's see check out and then, you know,\n\nactually I got a good recommendation\n\nfrom another friend here in my inbox,\n\nso I'd like to get to that now.\n\nWell, I can just swipe this draft down like this.\n\nGo right into another place, another message\n\nin my inbox, tap out a selection.\n\nThat looks like exactly what I want to send him\n\nso I'll just copy that.\n\nAnd now, with a tap at the bottom,\n\nI restore my draft just like that.\n\nI can paste and send it on its way.\n\nI think we're all going to love doing mail this way.\n\nThat's a quick look, few enhancements to iOS 8.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, let's talk about Spotlight.\n\nAnd of course, Spotlight is a super convenient way\n\nto search in your device.\n\nYou just pull down one on your home screen\n\nand you can execute these searches,\n\nfind things like launching apps or find an email message.\n\nBut now, with those same things we showed you in Yosemite,\n\nwith Spotlight Suggestions, you can get it so much more.\n\nYou can search for apps and find matches of apps that you don't\n\nyet have on the App Store.\n\nYou can search for points of interest\n\nand get Wikipedia entries and directions.\n\nYou can search for news, search for restaurants, songs,\n\nnot just in your own library but also on iTunes.\n\nAnd, when you search for a movie, you can get results both\n\nfor theaters nearby as well as content available for streaming.\n\nAnd, when you search inside of Safari in addition\n\nto your great Google Search suggestions,\n\nyou can also get a suggestion at a glance\n\nfor the answer you're looking for right\n\nfrom Spotlight Suggestions.\n\nSo, that is the new Spotlight.\n\nNext, the keyboard and the technology we call QuickType.\n\nOh.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nSo, prior to iPhone, this was the state-of-the-art\n\nin smartphone typing.\n\nBut, iPhone changed all of that with the introduction of Touch.\n\nAnd, we've been able to do so much more like access\n\nto special characters or alternate character sets,\n\nspecial keyboard layouts, even handwriting and dictation.\n\nBut, underlying it all have been the language models\n\nunder autocorrect.\n\nWell now, in iOS 8, QuickType supports predictive\n\ntyping suggestions.\n\nSo, as you type, you get suggestions\n\nfor the next words you might want to type,\n\nand you can tap things out faster than ever before\n\nand it's incredibly smart.\n\nSo, it's context sensitive.\n\nFor instance in messages, if someone asks you,\n\ndo you want to go for dinner or a movie?\n\nIt's going to suggest dinner or a movie.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd, it's personalized.\n\nIt learns how you type\n\nto different people in different apps.\n\nSo, maybe you're communicating with a co-worker and it's going\n\nto say, well, the meeting was canceled, rescheduled, moved.\n\nThese are kind of formal terms.\n\nBut now, if you're communicating with someone else,\n\nwe have a different communication style,\n\nyou might get the meeting was epic, awesome or a snoozer\n\nbecause it learns how you type.\n\nAnd, when it does, it does\n\nso in a way that's always protecting your privacy.\n\nAll that learning is done local to the device and none\n\nof your keystrokes leave the device.\n\nNow, QuickType has great language models\n\nfor all of these languages.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, I think we're all going to be typing a whole lot faster.\n\nNext of course, continuity.\n\nYou get all the great continuity features.\n\nSo now, on your iPads, you can pick\n\nup where you left off on your iPhone.\n\nYou can set up an instant hotspot\n\nwith no configuration on your iPad.\n\nYou can receive your messages on your iPad\n\nand when you receive a call from someone going like this,\n\nyou can pick it up right on your iPad.\n\nIt's really great and that's continuity.\n\nNext up, Messages.\n\nSo, Messages is the most frequently used app on iOS.\n\nAnd, in iOS 8, it's better than ever.\n\nSo, when it comes to group messaging,\n\nwe have some great enhancements.\n\nYou can now name your threads.\n\nYou can add or remove people from a conversation underway.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd, if you've ever been on one of those noisy threads\n\nthat just keeps buzzing in your pocket, well,\n\nyou can do not disturb on a per thread level and you can choose\n\nwhen to leave the tread.\n\nThis is pretty important.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, you also can share your location\n\nwith people in a conversation.\n\nAnd, if they've shared their location with you,\n\nyou can see it from write with inside messages.\n\nAnd you also have really great at a glance view of all\n\nof the pictures and attachments that are shared on any thread.\n\nBut one feature that I really love is our new Tap to Talk.\n\nYou just hold your finger down on the microphone button\n\nand then you can just swipe up with your finger\n\nwhen you're done talking and send what you said.\n\nAnd it's really great for video messaging as well.\n\nSo to give you a quick demo of the all new messages,\n\nI'd like to bring up Greg Joswiak to the stage.\n\nJos?\n\n[ Applause &amp; Cheering ]\n\nThank you Craig.\n\nIt's fun to be up here to be the first one\n\nto show you what a rich and powerful platform\n\nfor communication messages has become.\n\nSo let's get right into it.\n\nSo I got a message here waiting from my friend\n\nand co-worker, Kim Vorrath.\n\nSo I could just slide that of course as usual.\n\nIt goes right into my messages.\n\nAnd what I see here is I have a thread\n\nbetween me, Kim, and Craig.\n\nBut what I have that's new\n\nin the upper right hand corner is this Details button.\n\nSo if I tap it, it gives me all kinds of information\n\nabout participants in the message.\n\nFor one, Craig and Kim decided to share their location with me.\n\nSo Craig of course is up here with us\n\nin San Francisco while Kim is working hard back in Cupertino.\n\nThanks Kim for that.\n\nOne of the things I can do is add contacts.\n\nI can add people to this conversation as we go,\n\nbut I can also choose to share my location.\n\nSo if I just tap and Share My Location, I can choose\n\nto share my location for an hour for the rest of the day\n\nor I can keep sharing it until I stop somewhere in the future.\n\nBut what's really convenient is this Do Not Disturb button.\n\nHow many times you've been in one\n\nof those super chatty group conversations\n\nthat your phone is just continuing\n\nto buzz over and over?\n\nWell now, I can just choose to Do Not Disturb\n\nthat particular thread and not get my phone buzzing.\n\nSo, I'm going to find that useful with Kim\n\nand Craig, I know that for sure.\n\nOr I can even Leave this Conversation\n\nwith just a single tap.\n\nWhat's also convenient is the fact\n\nthat I have all the attachments, all the photos\n\nfrom this conversation all in one place.\n\nSo they still appear in line in the thread but now instead\n\nof trying to find that picture by scrolling, scrolling,\n\nscrolling, they all come in one place here in the thread,\n\nso very, very convenient.\n\nSo let's go back to that conversation,\n\nKim had asked me how it's going.\n\nWell, I have lots of ways to reply to her.\n\nI could tap out which just a few taps and, you know,\n\nuse my predictive keyboard, a message.\n\nBut it's even cooler that I can now do an audio or video message\n\nto her with just a swipe.\n\nSo I'll send back an audio message to her.\n\nHey Kim, I'm just hanging out here with about 6,000\n\nof our closest friends.\n\nHaving a good time while Craig takes a much deserved\n\nbreak backstage.\n\nSlide up, sends the message just like that.\n\nSuper easy.\n\nAnd I can do the same thing with a video message\n\nor even with a selfie.\n\nSo I'm going to dare a selfie here.\n\nIt's all down the camera button.\n\n[ Laughter &amp; Applause ]\n\nNot my best look.\n\nLet's see what Kim has to say about that.\n\nSo, I can see, I got an audio message from Kim,\n\nall I have to do is tap the play button and hear the message.\n\nImpressive Jos.\n\nYou've totally mastered the duck face selfie.\n\nWell, I'm glad she likes it.\n\nSo it's super duper easy to do this sort of things.\n\nYou notice that it said it would expire in a couple\n\nof minutes 'cause you don't want to have this clean this up.\n\nAudio and video messages can take up space\n\nso it self-destruct unless you choose\n\nto keep whoa, what's this?\n\nSo Craig should be backstage\n\nbut he apparently has sent me a message and it looks important.\n\nSo if you don't mind I'm going to play it back.\n\nAnd I can play it back in line even with a video message here.\n\nJos, we got a serious situation developing back here.\n\nI can't control this.\n\nThese are not going to work.\n\nBryan, you got to do something.\n\nI got it.\n\nJos, I'm going to need you to buy some more time.\n\n[ Laughter &amp; Applause ]\n\nNeedless to say, hair like that doesn't come easy.\n\nSo while he's dealing with his crisis backstage\n\noh look, I've actually got an audio message from him.\n\nNow, what's really cool is I can actually listen\n\nto audio messages and reply to them from the lock screen simply\n\nby raising the iPhone to my ear.\n\nHey Jos, we got the crisis contained back here.\n\nI'm good to go, so wrap it up whenever you're ready.\n\nAnd that's easy to listen to a message.\n\nI can reply to it the same way.\n\nCraig, it's good to hear\n\nthat you survived the great hair crisis of 2014.\n\nI'll get things wrapped up here\n\nand we'll get the show back to you.\n\nLower it and the message is sent.\n\nSuper easy.\n\nSo\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo that's the all new Messages app, super easy, super powerful.\n\nSend a message through just a swipe or even just\n\nby raising it to your ear.\n\nSo thank you everybody.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nOK. So next up, iCloud Drive.\n\nSo, of course, iCloud documents work great\n\nacross a single app on your iOS devices.\n\nBut now, with iCloud Drive, you also have a great way\n\nto work across applications.\n\nSo say you're in an app here like Sketchbook, you can bring\n\nup your iCloud Drive panel and open documents directly\n\nfrom other applications\n\nlike a compatible document inside of GoodReader.\n\nAnd when you open it up in that document, in that application\n\nand edit it, those edits are saved right back\n\nto their original locations.\n\nSo you don't end up with all\n\nof these different versions and copy problems.\n\nNow, of course, you also have access to all of those documents\n\non your Mac and on Windows as well.\n\nSo that's iCloud Drive.\n\nNext up, something you weren't expecting from me, Enterprise.\n\nNow it turns out that iOS\n\nyeah, they got one Enterprise guy over there, I know.\n\nSo iOS is a huge hit in the Enterprise.\n\nIn fact, 98 percent of the Fortune 500 uses iOS.\n\nAnd we're going to get the last two.\n\nAnd it's in part because of these great\n\niOS-tailored applications.\n\nBut it's also because of the amazing array of technologies,\n\nboth technologies that applied to all of us\n\nin protecting our privacy and security\n\nbut also Enterprise manageability features\n\nthat we've added to iOS over the years.\n\nNow, one of them that we just released\n\nin the last few months I think is emblematic of our philosophy\n\nof the Enterprise, and that's the Device Enrollment Program.\n\nNow traditionally, if you go to work at a company\n\nand they want you to give you a device, they actually have\n\nto take the device they give you, rip it out of its box,\n\nconnect it to some PC, image it with software\n\nto configure, it's a big pain.\n\nBut now with the Device Enrollment Program,\n\nyou can actually get your iPad or iPhone\n\nin its original shrink wrap box.\n\nAnd when you open it up, it'll automatically configure itself\n\nfor your Enterprise, setting up all of your mail\n\nand getting your mail messages, automatically setting\n\nup your calendar, and even downloading all your Enterprise\n\napps, it's that simple.\n\nWell now, in iOS 8, we continue our focus on security,\n\nproductivity and management.\n\niOS 8 has expanded data protection.\n\nSo you get passcode protection\n\nof all the major data types including third-party apps.\n\nWe have a Per-message S/MIME\n\nand we have a great productivity feature I think we're all going\n\nto like called VIP threads.\n\nSo now, there's a thread you're on or message you send,\n\nand you want to get notified\n\non the lock screen whenever there's a reply on that thread,\n\nyou can get that with just a tap.\n\nNow we also have Automatic Reply for Exchange, for Out of Office,\n\nFree/Busy information in calendar.\n\nAnd we support third-party Enterprise document providers\n\nin addition to iCloud, integrated right\n\nin to iCloud capable applications.\n\nNow we also improved our management\n\nyes, the Enterprise guy back there.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, we also extend our management\n\nto include managed books and PDFs,\n\nand this is of course especially valuable for education.\n\nSo those are just a few features for Enterprise.\n\nNow, something that we all care a lot about, Health.\n\nWhoa.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, developers have created a vast array of healthcare devices\n\nand accompanying applications,\n\neverything from monitoring your activity level,\n\nto your heart rate, to your weight,\n\nand chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure\n\nand diabetes, but up to now the information gathered\n\nby those applications lives in silos.\n\nYou can't get a single comprehensive picture\n\nof your health situation.\n\nBut now you can with HealthKit.\n\nHealthKit provides a single place\n\nthat applications can contribute to a composite profile\n\nof your activity and health.\n\nAnd HealthKit comes\n\nwith a corresponding application, Health.\n\nAnd with Health, you can monitor all of your metrics\n\nthat you're most interested in your activity.\n\nBut not just that, you can use third-party applications.\n\nNow we carefully protect your privacy\n\nso you have total control over which applications have access\n\nto which part of your healthcare information.\n\nBut you can for instance provide different activity, weight,\n\nheart rate information to the Nike app.\n\nAnd Nike is working to integrate HealthKit,\n\nso they use that information to help you in your pursuit\n\nof your personalized fitness goals.\n\nNow, we're also working with the Mayo Clinic,\n\ninnovators in healthcare.\n\nAnd with their integration with HealthKit, they're going\n\nto be able that when a patient takes let's say a blood pressure\n\nreading, HealthKit automatically notifies their app\n\nand their app is automatically able to check whether\n\nthat reading is within that patient's personalized\n\nhealthcare parameters and thresholds.\n\nAnd if not, it can contact the hospital proactively,\n\nnotify a doctor and that doctor can reach back\n\nto that patient providing more timely care.\n\nNow\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow we think this is going to be really important for healthcare\n\nand the CEO of the Mayo Clinic agrees.\n\nHe says that, \"We believe Apple's HealthKit will\n\nrevolutionize the health industry\n\nhow the health industry interacts with people.\n\nWe're proud to be at the forefront\n\nof this innovative technology with the Mayo Clinic app.\"\n\nWe agree. Now we're also working with leaders\n\nin healthcare applications like Epic systems.\n\nNow they provide the technology that enables hospitals serving\n\nover 100 million Americans.\n\nAnd so now with their integration with HealthKit,\n\npatients these leading institutions will be able\n\nto get closer in sharing their information\n\nwith their doctors and that is Health.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext up, Family Sharing.\n\nIt's the easy way to share what's important.\n\nNow when I was a kid,\n\nthe refrigerator was the center of family sharing.\n\nOur refrigerator looked just\n\nlike this except the kid who had gray hair.\n\nBut we've now in iOS made it that easy to set up your family\n\non their iOS devices and once you've set up your family\n\nas a family unit, you automatically get\n\nto share photos with the shared photo stream, to share calendars\n\nwith your family, to share reminder list\n\nand automatically configure things\n\nlike with permission, Find My Friends.\n\nAnd find your kid's devices, which is something I do\n\nabout every other day.\n\nIt's really handy.\n\nNow, of course, we're also used\n\nto in the home sharing physical media.\n\nBut increasingly, our media is in the form of songs\n\nfrom iTunes, movies, books, and apps.\n\nWell now, with Family Sharing,\n\nyou can get it not just your purchases but the purchase\n\nof all the members of your family.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nYou just click right through and download.\n\nAnd this is for up to six family members\n\nwho all share the same credit card.\n\nAnd it works great for kids as well and not just\n\nbecause they can make purchases on your credit card,\n\nbut in fact because when they do make a purchase,\n\nthey get prompted ask you for permission.\n\nAnd you automatically get messaged on your device.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd that's Family Sharing.\n\nNext, Photos.\n\nWe all take a lot of photos increasingly with our iPhones\n\nand we share them with whatever device we have handy.\n\nWell now, we're bringing together photos with iCloud\n\nso that every photo you take are available to you\n\non all of your devices.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nWe're not only preserving the common organization edits you do\n\nto all of your photos for your consistent iCloud photo library\n\nbut your device actually has access to more photos\n\nin the cloud than it can physically store locally\n\nso you can get them all wherever you are.\n\nNow of course, if you have these many photos,\n\nyou want great search and so we now on iOS 8 Photos,\n\nwe give you great search suggestions for instance\n\nof locations, photos taken near where you are right now,\n\nphotos taken a year ago today, photos taken in your home,\n\nbut we also give you search.\n\nAnd so that search lets you match on things like location,\n\ntime, and also on albums that you've set up.\n\nNow, we also help you perfect your photos\n\nwith great new Smart Editing controls.\n\nSo we have special smart controls for light and color\n\nand also for things like auto-straightening and cropping.\n\nI'd like to give you a demo of our new Photos app now.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAll right.\n\nLet's take a look at photos.\n\nSo here I am in my large cloud photo collection,\n\nand I have great search here, so I have all my suggestion\n\nbut I can also start typing and you notice I get matches\n\non location and time period.\n\nBut also an album, so here I have beach day with Mandy.\n\nAnd I can tap right in there,\n\nlook through these nice photos, let's take a look.\n\nThose are some good ones.\n\nNow that's a photo that I think has potential\n\nbut it's really quite dark and kind of washed out.\n\nUnfortunately, we have these great smart editing controls\n\nthat I can use to fix it up, so I'm going to bring up our levels\n\nand you also have levels for light and color\n\ndown there at the bottom.\n\nI'm going tap on light,\n\nand I get this great smart light meter.\n\nNow I can just drag this across like this and it lightens\n\nup the photo really nicely,\n\nso I dial that in just the way I want.\n\nBut what's happening under the hood is really amazing.\n\nYou notice that to achieve the lightning effect,\n\nit brought brightness and contrast up, exposure\n\nand highlights down and shadows up based\n\non detailed image analysis of what would achieve that effect.\n\nNow I could go in and I could manually try\n\nto tweak those parameters like have that level of control\n\nbut I don't need to because it does such a great job\n\nand I also have that control for color, so I can just drive\n\nup the color for instance, bring out the sky and the skin tones\n\nand I look at the difference of what we've been able\n\nto achieve before, after, it's really awesome.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow what's really great is that my edit\n\nof course immediately went up to my cloud photo library.\n\nAnd so they're available to all my devices,\n\nso let's take a look at my iPad.\n\nSo here's my iPad.\n\nNow I'm going to go on to my favorites album, and we notice\n\nthat right now in favorites, I don't have that picture\n\nbecause I didn't favorite it.\n\nBut now that I've made those nice edits,\n\nthe picture is looking great, I think I'll make it one\n\nof my favorites, I'll just tap on my iPhone on a little heart\n\nand you notice that it appears automatically here on my iPad,\n\nso I can go into that photo right here.\n\nNow we have those same editing controls tailored for iPad,\n\nso I'm going to go in to do a crop and do a kind\n\nof extreme close up crop here like this, hit done\n\nand of course these changes are going to go up live\n\nto my iPad photo library and it go right across to my phone.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo of course you may be wondering what about the Mac?\n\nWell good news, we are working on a new grounds\n\nup photo solution for the Mac built with iCloud in mind,\n\nand that's going to be shipping early next year but I'd\n\nlike to give you a sneak peek now.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo let's take a look at photos on the Mac.\n\nAs you see, I get beautiful buttery scrolling here.\n\nI have my moments right here, I can pinch out if I want\n\nfrom moments to collections and all the way out to years.\n\nI can scrub through my photos like this even in year view.\n\nIf I find a photo I like, just let go and zoom right in.\n\nYou watch as I magnify this photo, the interplay\n\nwith the title bar, it's really gorgeous.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and browse through these a little bit.\n\nNow here's a photo that looks really\n\nlike it's got some potential\n\nbut it could use some brightening up,\n\ncan have the same kinds of adjustments.\n\nYou notice here at this light and color meters, well,\n\nI can just close this control, so we can watch what happens\n\nin real time as I make the lighting adjustment.\n\nAnd notice how some of these are going up and some are going\n\ndown to create this effect, it's really great.\n\nI can do the same with color, let's just boost the color,\n\nbring out the sky, bring out the skin tones, and it's that easy,\n\nthe new photos app, to really create beautiful images.\n\nAnd that's a quick preview of photos coming to Yosemite\n\nin the future and to the new photo solution\n\nwith iCloud photo library coming with iOS 8.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo now on iOS 8, you get all your photos\n\nin your organization crush your iOS devices and soon\n\nwith your Mac and via the web, Windows as well.\n\nNow this is all your photos and also your videos.\n\nAnd these are in their original format\n\nand their full resolution.\n\nNow this uses your iCloud storage,\n\nso your first 5 gigs are free.\n\nAnd we have some great new affordable plans coming,\n\nwhere you get 20 gigs for just 99 cents a month and 200 gigs\n\nfor 3.99, so we can all afford\n\nto get all our photos safely up in the cloud.\n\nThat is photos.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, a great set of major features coming to iOS.\n\nBut of course, there's always a whole lot more\n\nthan I have time to talk about here.\n\nI do want to hit on just two more quickly, and one is Siri.\n\nNow, we have if you take your phone and you plug it\n\nin for instance in the car, you can say, \"Hey Siri,\"\n\nand start talking to Siri without having\n\nto even touch your phone.\n\nAnd we have song recognition with Shazam.\n\nSo now, if you just start up Siri and there's a song playing\n\naround you, it will tell you what it is\n\nand you can even purchase it right there from within Siri.\n\nSiri also now supports streaming voice recognition.\n\nSo as you talk, you can see what it's recognizing.\n\nIt's more responsive than ever, and we have support\n\nfor 22 new dictation languages.\n\nFinally, in China we now have greatly improved maps\n\nwith vector based maps and turn by turn directions.\n\nWe also have support for lunar calendar which is great\n\nfor holidays and birthdays.\n\nImproved Chinese predictive input and improved weather data.\n\nSo that is a look thank you.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo that's a look at the consumer part of iOS 8.\n\nTo tell you the other half of the story,\n\nI'm going to hand it back to Tim.\n\nThanks.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThanks, Craig.\n\nAmazing new features, and if we ended the keynote now it would\n\nbe a giant release.\n\nBut there is a lot more.\n\nThe second part of the story is what iOS 8 provides\n\nfor developers.\n\nAnd extending your capability to make even more incredible apps\n\nand apps you could not create before.\n\nNow, all of these apps are delivered via the App Store.\n\nThe App Store now has over 1.2 million of your apps on it.\n\nThis is a phenomenal number.\n\nAnd the marketplace around these apps is unbelievably vibrant,\n\n300,000,000 people visit the App Store every week.\n\nAnd these people aren't just browsing, they are downloading.\n\nThey've now downloaded over 75 billion apps.\n\nThese are mind blowing numbers.\n\nNow, what we want to do is make the App Store even better.\n\nAnd so, we're rolling out a number of new features\n\non the store, starting with we're adding an Explore tab\n\nto help users find the app they're looking for more.\n\nSo you can browse through categories and subcategories.\n\nWe're adding top trending searches\n\nto make search even better.\n\nIt's great to see WWDC at the top by the way.\n\nWe're making finding your search even better\n\nby making it faster by adding a continuous scrolling list.\n\nWe're adding related searches to make it easier\n\nto find exactly the app you're looking for.\n\nAnd with the new Editor's Choice logo,\n\nusers can find the best apps.\n\nAlso for the first time,\n\nwe're giving the developers the capability to form app bundles,\n\nso users can buy multiple apps\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nI do read your emails.\n\nSo users can buy multiple apps\n\nat a discounted price with just one tap.\n\nAlso, we're introducing app previews,\n\nso developers can make short videos\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nso developers can make short videos of some great features.\n\nAnd the users can make certain it's an app\n\nthat they would want.\n\nWe're also introducing for the first time today a new service,\n\na new beta test service called TestFlight.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nDevelopers can invite users to beta test their app\n\nand get the results right in TestFlight, and it's all free.\n\nNow, there are many more features at the App Store\n\nand you hear about them through the week\n\nand in the afternoon sessions\n\nbut we are really investing a ton in the App Store.\n\nIt is a huge release.\n\nEverything will be available in the fall.\n\nNow, that brings us to the SDK.\n\nAnd for those of you that are not developers,\n\nthe SDK is a Software Development Kit\n\nthat enables developers to make all of the amazing apps.\n\nThis release is the biggest release\n\nsince the launch of the App Store.\n\nAnd it will give developers the capabilities and tools\n\nto make things that you haven't dreamed of\n\nand to push to a whole new level.\n\nAnd to tell you all about the SDK,\n\nI want to invite my colleague, Superman, back to the stage.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThis is clearly some kind\n\nof endurance training thing Tim is doing to me.\n\nSo, with this year's SDK, the team has done just an unreal job\n\nwith over 4,000 new developer APIs.\n\nNow, I want to start with something\n\nthat I think is perhaps most profound\n\nand that's Extensibility.\n\nSo with Extensibility, applications\n\nfrom the App Store will be able to extend the system\n\nand offer services to other apps.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow of course, one\n\nof the reasons we're also comfortable installing\n\nso many apps from the App Store are iOS' security model.\n\nApps are isolated inside of sandboxes\n\nwhere they can access their own data but can't get\n\nat your personal information or mess with other apps\n\nwithout your permission.\n\nWell, the handle Extensibility in an iOS way,\n\nwe wanted to build on the same sandboxing model.\n\nSo now extensions live inside an application's own sandbox\n\nwith access to its own data, but other applications can reach\n\nout by way of iOS' security mechanisms,\n\ntalk to that extension.\n\nThat extension can even project UI right back\n\nin to the originating app.\n\nNow this enables some great things.\n\nFor instance, in addition\n\nto the systems built-in sharing options,\n\nan app like Pinterest can offer share sheet to Safari.\n\nAnd if you look at actions, for instance,\n\nan app like Bing could offer translation right inside\n\nof Safari accessing the web pages web content right there.\n\nNow we're also supporting photo filters inside the photos,\n\nand enabling third parties\n\nto define their own document providers that work\n\nwithin the iCloud drive-enabled application.\n\nFinally, we're enabling third party apps to define widgets\n\nthat can now go in Notification Center.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nI think it feels like time for a demo.\n\nSo let's start with photo filters.\n\nSo, we're back here in photos\n\nand I've got a nice photo here of a flower.\n\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and edit and you notice an addition\n\nto the options here at the bottom of the screen,\n\nwe have at the top left this extensions button.\n\nI'm going to click that, tap that rather.\n\nAnd you notice I have several extensions available,\n\none from VSCO Cam and one from Waterlogue.\n\nI'm going to select Waterlogue.\n\nAnd now the Waterlogue extension is able to run right here\n\nin the context of photos to manipulate my photo bringing\n\nup their own UI, deliver this beautiful water color effect\n\nto my photo, and when I'm done, it's right back inside\n\nof my photo album, it's that easy.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThen next let's take a look at widgets.\n\nSo I'm going to just pull down Notification Center.\n\nI have my existing widgets here in my Today view.\n\nDid you notice an addition to my widget is down here\n\nat the bottom it says \"One New Widget Available\"\n\nbecause I've downloaded an app recently\n\nthat contains a Notification Center widget.\n\nSo I'm going to tap Edit.\n\nAnd you notice its SportsCenter.\n\nSo I can tap the plus next to SportsCenter,\n\nposition it where I want, I'm on my widgets in my Today view.\n\nTap Done, and now I have information\n\non my favorite sports teams right here inside\n\nof Notification Center.\n\nNow this works great on iPad as well.\n\nLet's take a look at iPad.\n\nSo iPad, I'm going to bring down Notification Center.\n\nAnd you notice I have this interactive widget from eBay.\n\nSo, I'm bidding on a guitar and apparently I'm being outbid.\n\nSo I can now write inside of notification, take advantage\n\nof the interactivity widgets.\n\nI can tap and bid and just like this,\n\nI can submit a leading bid all inside of Notification Center.\n\nNow to wrap it up, I want to show you extensions in Safari.\n\nI'm going to bring up Safari.\n\nUse our great new tab view.\n\nIt's a page I've been looking at here with some information\n\non a beautiful guitar and I'd like to learn more about it but,\n\nunfortunately, you notice the text here is in Japanese\n\nand I do not read Japanese.\n\nFortunately, I have a Bing translation extension,\n\nso I can just bring up my action sheet.\n\nAnd you notice down here in the second row, Bing translate,\n\nI'm going to tap on that and Bing is able\n\nto translate this web page right in line.\n\nLook at that.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow for our extension's grand finale,\n\nlet's put that on my Pinterest board.\n\nYou see Pinterest has an extension right here.\n\nI'm going to tap on that and this is actually able to bring\n\nup a UI defined by Pinterest where I can select my board,\n\nmaybe select my guitar's board.\n\nNow the Pinterest extension is accessed\n\nto the underlying web page, so I can\n\nlet me slide through the different photos\n\non the page till I find the one I want to share.\n\nThat's it.\n\nTap and I pinned it.\n\nAnd that's a quick look at extensions in iOS 8.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow there's one important kind of extension that I did fail\n\nto mention and that's the ability\n\nto install system-wide third party keyboards.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo now if you have special keyboard you want to use,\n\nyou can install those in iOS.\n\nAnd by default, those of course run inside\n\nof the most restrictive sandbox with no network access\n\nbecause we want to make sure to protect your privacy.\n\nBut if that keyboard requires or you want to grant it ability,\n\nit can ask for access to the network\n\nto provide extended functionality.\n\nWe put those controls in your hands.\n\nThat's extensions on iOS 8.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext up, Touch ID.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nFrom the moment we introduced Touch ID,\n\ndevelopers were excited about the potential\n\nand there's no question why,\n\nTouch ID has been extremely popular\n\nand people authenticating in their devices.\n\nIf you look at passcode usage\n\non iOS before Touch ID was less than half.\n\nOn iPhone 5s 83 percent, people love using Touch ID.\n\nAnd now, third party apps can take advantage\n\nof Touch ID as well.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo Touch ID protects logins and user data and it works\n\nby unlocking Keychain items.\n\nSo it identifies successful fingerprint matches\n\nbut it always keeps the fingerprint data itself\n\ncompletely protected inside\n\nof the Secure Enclave in the A7 processor.\n\nThe fingerprint information is never exposed\n\nto third party apps or the rest of the system for that matter.\n\nIt's very secure.\n\nThat's Touch ID.\n\nThen next, Cameras.\n\nWe're providing Camera APIs from manual control of exposure,\n\nwhite balance and focus.\n\nAnd we've enhanced the PhotoKit API with faster performance,\n\nthe ability not just to read but also to write\n\nto the photo library and this is now your cloud photo library\n\nand perform non-destructive edits.\n\nIt's really great.\n\nNow, we talked about the great HealthKit API,\n\nbut now we'd also have HomeKit.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow, there are a lot of great home automation devices coming\n\non the market these days and they have companion apps,\n\nthings like lights and door locks, webcams,\n\ngarage doors, and thermostats.\n\nBut, you know, each of them have their own application\n\nand they end up defining their own network protocol,\n\ntheir own security mechanisms.\n\nWell, we thought we could bring some rationality to the space.\n\nWe started working with the leaders\n\nin home automation devices.\n\nAnd we've come up with HomeKit with a common network protocol\n\nthat has secure pairing to ensure\n\nthat only your iPhone can open your garage door\n\nor unlock your door.\n\nAnd in addition to being able to control individual devices\n\nin your home, with HomeKit you can group devices and changes\n\nin the scenes and then with Siri integration you can say\n\nsomething like, \"Get ready for bed,\" and be assured\n\nthat your garage door is closed, your door is locked,\n\nthe thermostat is lower,\n\nand your lights are dimmed, that's HomeKit.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext, CloudKit.\n\nSo today, if you're a developer\n\nand you're writing an application\n\nand it needs a web component, well, you end up really having\n\nto write two apps in one.\n\nIn addition to the writing in the client side using Xcode\n\nand our frameworks, you have\n\nto write the server side of the app.\n\nYou have to write server side app logic, you have to deal\n\nwith authentication, asset storage, database storage,\n\nsearch, even push notifications and then you got\n\nto pay somebody to host it all.\n\nWell, now, with CloudKit, CloudKit takes\n\nover the cloud part and provide you\n\nwith a client side programming model\n\nthat lets you access iCloud authentication storage,\n\nsearch and more.\n\nAnd when it comes to paying,\n\nCloudKit is effectively free, with limits.\n\nSo, CloudKit scales the data allocated to your app\n\nand bandwidth based on the number of users using your app.\n\nAnd this goes all the way up to granting you free a petabyte\n\nof assets, 10 terabytes of database\n\nand all the bandwidth you can constructively use.\n\nThat is CloudKit.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNext, I want to move on to something huge in the area\n\nof 3D graphics, and it's called Metal, so\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nAs you know, OpenGL is the standards based way\n\nfor high performance 3D graphics on iOS, giving you access\n\nto the power of the A7 processor.\n\nBut increasingly, if you look at what goes on in the performance\n\nof the game, in addition to what the game wants to accomplish,\n\nOpenGL ends up being a thick layer of overhead\n\nbetween the game and the hardware.\n\nWell, now, we have Metal.\n\nAnd Metal dramatically reduces\n\nthat overhead giving the game near bare\n\nto the metal access to the power of A7.\n\nThe results are stunning up to 10x faster draw call rates.\n\nNow, in addition to these dramatically reduced overheads,\n\nyou get access not just to graphics\n\nbut to the compute power of the GPU,\n\nand Metal supports pre-compiled shaders\n\nand efficient multithreading\n\nso you can always get the most out of the processor.\n\nNow, we've been working with the leading providers\n\nof gaming engines on mobile platforms\n\nand what they've been able to accomplish with Metal\n\nin just a few weeks is truly stunning.\n\nLet's start with EA and the work they've done taking their\n\nconsole level title Plants vs. Zombies and bringing it to iOS.\n\nThey're able to put over 1.3 million triangles on the screen\n\nat a time and do depth of motion, effects,\n\ndepth of field effects that they could never imagine achieving.\n\nIn fact, they're using their Frostbyte console engine\n\nthat they thought could never come to mobile and now it can.\n\nAnd let's look at Crytek.\n\nCrytek was able to bring their console-level geom cache to iOS\n\nand they were able to get\n\nup to 4000 draw calls per frame going here.\n\nThis is up to 10x, the kind\n\nof performance they were seeing previously.\n\nNow, to show you live what can be done with Metal,\n\nI'd like to bring up the founder of Epic Games\n\nto the stage, Tim Sweeney.\n\nTim, come on up.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThank you.\n\nWe've had the opportunity to work with Metal\n\nand to illustrate some of the possibilities,\n\nwe created a Zen Garden.\n\nNow this environment was built\n\nin Unreal Engine 4 on a high-end Mac.\n\nAnd now thanks to Metal, we're running it on iPad in Realtime\n\nwith full fidelity and performance.\n\nMetal's efficiency enable us an order of magnitude increase\n\nin detail making it possible for developers like us\n\nto create a new generation of vivid\n\nand interactive 3D experiences.\n\nNow Josh Adams is the programmer who wrote much\n\nof the code that's running.\n\nJosh, can you explain what we're seeing here?\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nFirst of all thanks to Metal support for precompiled shaders,\n\nwe can have a huge variety of materials\n\nwithout a load time impact.\n\nAnd our first stop we'll check out this cherry tree\n\nwhere I can drag on the screen to paint the petals\n\non to the tree and they start falling to the ground.\n\nThere are about 5,000 petals here being physically simulated\n\nand I can interact with them by touching on the screen\n\nto blow wind through the area.\n\nAll right, next up we have a Koi pond filled\n\nwith hundreds of fish.\n\nMetal has freed up enough CPU time and we can have each\n\nof them running their own artificial intelligence\n\nwhich you can see here as I drag around the water.\n\nAnd there's a few more fish here than a real Koi pond\n\nbut since Metal lets us do it, we figured why not.\n\nAnd of course every Zen garden needs some sand to rake.\n\nSo I go over here I can rake any pattern I want\n\ninto the sand here.\n\nNow artist love that they can make an effect like this\n\nwithout needing a programmer like me to make\n\nthat one-off effect for a drop core reduction\n\nor other optimizations.\n\nAnd for our final moment of Zen walk\n\nover to this water fountain.\n\nNow I can tap on it, pour out some water which then turns\n\nto a couple hundred butterflies\n\nbut of course not going to stop there.\n\nSo I can touch the screen to call more of them to me\n\nand then guide them around the area.\n\nSo there are about 3,500 individually animated\n\nand rendered butterfly meshes here.\n\nNow I had to keep telling the artist to turn the numbers up\n\nand up because they do not think it was going to be possible.\n\nPretty cool huh?\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThanks.\n\nThere are thousands of objects being rendered here and it seem\n\nthat we couldn't have dreamed of building prior\n\nto Metal delivering a tenfold increase\n\nin rendering efficiency.\n\nTo have this level of graphics capability on iPhone\n\nand iPad now is a stunning breakthrough.\n\nWe're proud to have been a part of it and of course we'd love\n\nto share this with you.\n\nSo as soon as iOS 8 is available we will be making\n\nthat Zen garden available in the app store for free.\n\nThank you.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nIts amazing and that was it's easy to forget on an iPad.\n\nIts incredible graphics they were able to achieve\n\nand I think we are all feeling very Zen now.\n\nSo that's very good.\n\nSo that's Metal.\n\nNow I want to move from high-end 3D gaming\n\nto casual gaming in Sprite Kit.\n\nWe introduced Sprite Kit last year at WWDC.\n\nAnd it's been a big hit\n\nwith people building casual games on the app store.\n\nAnd now this year we've really enhanced Sprite Kit\n\nwith some things that make your casual games just\n\nthat much more fun.\n\nWe have support for light sources, field forces,\n\nper-pixel physics that actually allow your objects\n\nto automatically interact with proper physics based\n\non their drawn shapes and even inverse kinematics.\n\nAnd now also this year for the first time\n\non iOS we're bringing SceneKit.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow SceneKit is a 3D scene renderer\n\nand now it's been enhanced as designed for casual games\n\nwith an integrated physics engine, particle systems\n\nand support for scripted actions.\n\nSo these are two great solutions for casual games on iOS.\n\nNext, Xcode\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow Xcode is the tool set we use\n\nto build all applications for the Mac and iOS.\n\nAnd Xcode is in fact one\n\nof the most popular pro-apps on our platform.\n\nThe last version was downloaded 14 million times.\n\nIt's unbelievable.\n\nNow of course central to Xcode is the language we use\n\nto develop our apps, Objective-C.\n\nNow Objective-C has served us so well for 20 years.\n\nWe absolutely love it.\n\nBut we had to ask ourselves the question what would it be\n\nlike if we had Objective-C without the baggage of C?\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nWell we did more than think about it.\n\nWe have a new programming language.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThe language is called Swift and it totally rules [laughter].\n\nSwift is fast.\n\nIt is modern.\n\nIt is designed for safety.\n\nAnd it enables the level of interactivity and development\n\nthat you've never seen on the platform.\n\nWhen it comes to speed, Swift is great.\n\nCompare Python a popular scripting language\n\nwith Objective-C, when it comes to something like,\n\nlet's say complex object sort.\n\nObjective-C is a lot faster.\n\nBut Swift is faster still.\n\nAnd take something like RC4 encryption extremely\n\ncomputationally intensive.\n\nPython gets utterly crushed in this particular benchmark.\n\nAnd Objective but look at Swift.\n\nNow Swift is also modern with features like Closures,\n\nGenerics, Type inference,\n\nMultiple return types, and Namespaces.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nYou know how many people at home are going,\n\nwhat the heck are these guys talking about?\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\nWith Swift you're able to reduce a common pattern\n\nthat you might see in your Objective-C code like this.\n\nAnd reduce it to something as simple as this.\n\nAnd Swift defines away large classes\n\nof common programming errors they just aren't possible.\n\nNow, Swift is completely native to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.\n\nIt's built with the same LLVM compiler\n\nas Objective-C using the same Optimizer and Autovectorizer.\n\nAnd it has the same ARC memory management model.\n\nAnd the same runtime which means\n\nthat your Swift code can fit right alongside your Objective-C\n\nand your C code in the same application.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nNow Swift also enables a level dynamism and interactivity\n\nin development that we've never seen before\n\nfor the feature we call playgrounds.\n\nTo demonstrate Swift and playgrounds in action,\n\nI'd like to bring to the stage Chris Lattner.\n\nCome on up Chris.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThank you Craig.\n\nI am thrilled to be here and to be the first person\n\nto give you a taste of Swift.\n\nLet me show you how fun\n\nand interactive it is to write Swift code.\n\nThis is the Swift playground,\n\nas I start typing I get an immediately response.\n\nIt is actually running my code as I type it\n\nand displaying the result in the sidebar to the right.\n\nOf course, Swift user type inference\n\nand has powerful string processing capabilities\n\nwhich make it as easy to use as a scripting language\n\nwithout sacrificing any performance.\n\nSwift was designed from the ground up for Cocoa\n\nand Cocoa Touch, so of course I have their full power\n\nat my fingertips.\n\nNow, I can build anything with Swift\n\nfrom a social media application all the way\n\nup to a high-performance, 3D game using Metal.\n\nBut today to keep it simple,\n\nI think I'll write a simple casual 2D game.\n\nLet's start by using NSImage.\n\nLet's start by using NSImage to load a resource.\n\nAs you can see here, I've\n\nthe playground sees I've loaded an image,\n\nI can ever see it right here from within Xcode.\n\nNow, Swift is loaded with high-end features like Generics\n\nthat allow me to get a lot done with very little code.\n\nHere you can see I'm using an array of strings\n\nand using the functional map algorithm to apply closure\n\nto every element which allows me to load an entire list\n\nof images all with the simple line of code.\n\nNow, all these resources of part of this game that I'm working on\n\nand one piece I still need to finish up is the flight path\n\nfor the blimp that we have.\n\nNow this is a simple loop that computes the position\n\nfor the blimp overtime as my game plays.\n\nAnd in addition to seeing individual values Swift\n\nplaygrounds even allow me to visualize the entire history\n\nof a value overtime as my application runs.\n\nAnd so now I can immediately see\n\nthat this equation will cause my blimp to slowly sink\n\nas the scene plays out.\n\nBut I think I can do better\n\nand that's not exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nSo I can change the code and I get an immediate response.\n\nSimply by changing the equation the blimp will now rise and fall\n\nas the scene plays out which is a lot more\n\nof what I'm looking for.\n\nSo, now that we have this the way we want, we can take this\n\nand copy it and let's go to the game that I'm working on.\n\nIt's right here.\n\nNow, this is a playground just like before.\n\nBut here, I have a game in the code written using Sprite Kit.\n\nNow, you can see our blimp going left and right,\n\nstraight across the scene.\n\nAnd, I can try out the flight path\n\nthat we just developed simply by pasting it in\n\nand getting the immediate feedback I'm looking for.\n\nNow, the blimp is rising and falling just like I wanted.\n\nBecause Swift enables such powerful interactive\n\nand dynamic programming experiences,\n\nit makes it really easy to try out new things.\n\nAnd, just by adding a few lines of code,\n\nI can enable Sprite Kit's per pixel collisions, field forces\n\nand lighting effects gaining a much more interesting result.\n\nNow, Swift Playgrounds even give you full power over time.\n\nAnd, with this timeline at the bottom of the screen,\n\nI can go forwards and backwards\n\nthrough the execution of my game.\n\nSo, I can really see those effects in action.\n\nYou can see the balloons interacting with each other\n\nand with the blimp just like that.\n\nPlaygrounds give me unprecedented power\n\nto see my app in detail and give me full control when I want\n\nto refine and polish my application.\n\nBut, of course, Swift works great with Xcode\n\nand runs great on iOS.\n\nSo, let's now jump and see what the finished product looks like.\n\nHere we go.\n\nAnd, this is the game that we just built.\n\nIt looks pretty great.\n\nNow, as Craig told you earlier,\n\nwe've also brought Scene Kit to iOS.\n\nWith Scene Kit, it's super easy\n\nto build a 3D version of our game.\n\nAnd, that's just a quick taste and quick look at Swift.\n\nI think you guys are going to absolutely love it.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, that's Swift.\n\nIt gives you access to all of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.\n\nSo, you can build everything from a simple example,\n\nlike you saw there with Chris,\n\nto the most powerful applications you can imagine.\n\nAnd Swift is going to be ready for primetime out of the gates.\n\nIt comes with complete Xcode support with indexing,\n\ncode completion and debugging.\n\nAnd, there's a Swift language guide available to you now\n\nin iBooks along with complete reference documentation.\n\nAnd, when iOS and OS X are available, day one,\n\nyou can submit apps written in Swift to the App Store.\n\nThat is Swift.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nSo, as you've been able to see,\n\niOS 8 is a huge developer release\n\nand a great end user release with features\n\nlike the new QuickType keyboard, Tap to Talk in Messages, Health,\n\nfamily sharing and great new photos\n\nwith iCloud photo library.\n\nBut, it's also an unprecedented developer release\n\nwith technology like extensions, Metal and Swift.\n\nThat's iOS 8.\n\nIt's going to be available to those of you here in Beta today.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nAnd, you guessed it, available to everyone else in the fall\n\nand it will run on all of these devices.\n\nThat is iOS 8.\n\nThank you.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nGreat job.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nIt's an incredible set of features\n\nand an incredible release.\n\nIt's been a fun morning.\n\nYou can probably see that from us.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed it as well.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThank you.\n\nThis morning, you've seen Yosemite, the future of OS X\n\nwith an incredible new design, amazing new features\n\nand engineered to work seamlessly with iOS.\n\nYou've seen iOS 8, the biggest release of iOS\n\nsince the introduction of the App Store.\n\nIt's huge for developers and massive for everyone else.\n\nAnd perhaps, more importantly,\n\nyou've seen how our operating systems, devices\n\nand services all work together in harmony.\n\nTogether, they provide an integrated\n\nand continuous experience across all of our products.\n\nAnd, you've seen how developers can extend their experience\n\nfurther than they've ever done before\n\nand how they can create powerful apps even faster and more easily\n\nthan they've ever been able to.\n\nApple engineers platforms, devices and services together,\n\nwe do this so we can create a seamless experience\n\nfor our users that is unparalleled in the industry.\n\nThis is something only Apple can do.\n\nYou've seen a few people on stage this morning\n\nbut there are thousands of people that made today possible.\n\nAnd I'd like to take a moment before we depart\n\nand recognize them.\n\nWould everyone from Apple stand up that had something to do\n\nwith bringing today making today possible?\n\nStand up, don't be bashful.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd, there's thousands more back in Cupertino who were watching\n\nand I want to thank them, too, and from all over the world.\n\nIt's a privilege of a lifetime for me to work with all\n\nof these incredible people.\n\nI hope everyone has a huge conference.\n\nEnjoy the week.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[ Applause ]",

data-timecode=\"231.426\">to gain functionality and independence.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=234.796\" data-timecode=\"234.796\">I enjoy being known as the kid with the bionic arm.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=240.366\" data-timecode=\"240.366\">You know, it's something interesting,</span> <span id=\"t=242.026\" data-timecode=\"242.026\">and it's something different,</span> <span id=\"t=243.086\" data-timecode=\"243.086\">and I'm a big fan of being different.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=245.516\" data-timecode=\"245.516\">[ Music ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=255.296\" data-timecode=\"255.296\">You open up an app and you open up a possibility</span> <span id=\"t=259.386\" data-timecode=\"259.386\">and a whole world is being born.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=261.136\" data-timecode=\"261.136\">What we really have is an intersection</span> <span id=\"t=264.586\" data-timecode=\"264.586\">between technology and art.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=267.536\" data-timecode=\"267.536\">You see the world in a different way and I think an app can do</span> <span id=\"t=270.266\" data-timecode=\"270.266\">that because it really does open something you didn't</span> <span id=\"t=272.726\" data-timecode=\"272.726\">know beforehand.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=277.546\" data-timecode=\"277.546\">Developers are doing extraordinary things.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=279.426\" data-timecode=\"279.426\">I can't believe what they're creating today, it's genius.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=282.266\" data-timecode=\"282.266\">If I met the person that made Sky Go,</span> <span id=\"t=283.546\" data-timecode=\"283.546\">I'd probably give him a massive hug.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=285.266\" data-timecode=\"285.266\">You inspire me so much.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=286.906\" data-timecode=\"286.906\">They make our lives better and they think of things that,</span> <span id=\"t=289.566\" data-timecode=\"289.566\">obviously, regular people can't think of.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=291.916\" data-timecode=\"291.916\">I don't know how the technology works,</span> <span id=\"t=293.156\" data-timecode=\"293.156\">it's just magic to me.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=294.716\" data-timecode=\"294.716\">There's no question they are changing the world.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=296.716\" data-timecode=\"296.716\">So, to everyone who's made any apps</span> <span id=\"t=298.206\" data-timecode=\"298.206\">that I've ever enjoyed I say, \"Thank

</p>\n<p><span id=\"t=323.216\" data-timecode=\"323.216\">Welcome to San Francisco.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=326.186\" data-timecode=\"326.186\">We're here today and all week</span> <span id=\"t=328.876\" data-timecode=\"328.876\">to celebrate the developer community and all</span> <span id=\"t=332.046\" data-timecode=\"332.046\">of the amazing apps that they've created.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=334.846\" data-timecode=\"334.846\">I hope that video did a great job</span> <span id=\"t=338.636\" data-timecode=\"338.636\">of capturing just how deeply we feel</span> <span id=\"t=341.726\" data-timecode=\"341.726\">about out developer community and more importantly the number</span> <span id=\"t=346.266\" data-timecode=\"346.266\">of lives they've enriched.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=348.556\" data-timecode=\"348.556\">So from all of Apple, thank you very much.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=352.516\" data-timecode=\"352.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=361.396\" data-timecode=\"361.396\">This is a milestone year for this conference.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=364.256\" data-timecode=\"364.256\">It's the 25th anniversary of the conference.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=367.806\" data-timecode=\"367.806\">It started in 1990 with just 1,300 developers, who gathered</span> <span id=\"t=373.346\" data-timecode=\"373.346\">to talk about the System 7.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=375.906\" data-timecode=\"375.906\">And there was one lab in that developer conference.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=379.806\" data-timecode=\"379.806\">Now, WWDC is a huge conference for Apple and a huge conference</span> <span id=\"t=385.146\" data-timecode=\"385.146\">for all of our developers.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=388.046\" data-timecode=\"388.046\">We have over a thousand of our best</span> <span id=\"t=390.796\" data-timecode=\"390.796\">and brightest engineers here today to talk with you directly</span> <span id=\"t=395.576\" data-timecode=\"395.576\">in labs, about how to improve your code.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=399.736\" data-timecode=\"399.736\">We've got people from more countries than ever before,</span> <span id=\"t=404.866\" data-timecode=\"404.866\">and two-thirds of the attendees today are here</span> <span id=\"t=408.516\" data-timecode=\"408.516\">at a developer's conference for the very first time.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=412.516\" data-timecode=\"412.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=419.256\" data-timecode=\"419.256\">A special shout-out this morning</span> <span id=\"t=422.206\" data-timecode=\"422.206\">to the student scholarship winners.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=425.126\" data-timecode=\"425.126\">They worked really hard to get here.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=427.516\" data-timecode=\"427.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=434.826\" data-timecode=\"434.826\">Our youngest developer in the audience today is 13.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=439.516\" data-timecode=\"439.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=443.936\" data-timecode=\"443.936\">We're going to be seeing apps from them for a long time.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=448.066\" data-timecode=\"448.066\">The developer community is incredibly vibrant.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=451.236\" data-timecode=\"451.236\">We now have 9 million registered developers.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=455.546\" data-timecode=\"455.546\">That's up almost 50 percent since last year.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=459.096\" data-timecode=\"459.096\">That's the most developers we've ever added in a single year.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=463.866\" data-timecode=\"463.866\">Now, this morning, we're gathered to talk</span> <span id=\"t=466.496\" data-timecode=\"466.496\">about two powerful platforms, OS X and iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=472.556\" data-timecode=\"472.556\">And you are going to see some great new features for both,</span> <span id=\"t=476.736\" data-timecode=\"476.736\">and some great updates.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=479.036\" data-timecode=\"479.036\">But even more importantly, you're going</span> <span id=\"t=481.976\" data-timecode=\"481.976\">to see how they've been engineered</span> <span id=\"t=484.406\" data-timecode=\"484.406\">to work seamlessly together.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=487.996\" data-timecode=\"487.996\">Now, you're also going to see the mother</span> <span id=\"t=491.846\" data-timecode=\"491.846\">of all releases for developers.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=496.126\" data-timecode=\"496.126\">It's a huge release and it's so huge</span> <span id=\"t=499.716\" data-timecode=\"499.716\">that we've dedicated an entire section</span> <span id=\"t=502.636\" data-timecode=\"502.636\">of the presentation just for this.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=506.516\" data-timecode=\"506.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=513.645\" data-timecode=\"513.645\">So, let's get started with OS X and the Mac.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=517.706\" data-timecode=\"517.706\">We're shipping the best Macs in our history.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=521.446\" data-timecode=\"521.446\">If you look just in this last fiscal year,</span> <span id=\"t=525.576\" data-timecode=\"525.576\">while the industry declined by 5 percent Macs grew by 12 percent,</span> <span id=\"t=532.796\" data-timecode=\"532.796\">that's swelled our installed base of Macs to over 80 million,</span> <span id=\"t=538.196\" data-timecode=\"538.196\">which is a record for us.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=540.116\" data-timecode=\"540.116\">We're really proud of this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=542.376\" data-timecode=\"542.376\">And of course our latest release</span> <span id=\"t=544.416\" data-timecode=\"544.416\">of OS X Mavericks has done really great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=548.146\" data-timecode=\"548.146\">It had great features for power users like power tabs, and tags,</span> <span id=\"t=553.706\" data-timecode=\"553.706\">and enhanced support for multiple displays.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=556.526\" data-timecode=\"556.526\">Advanced technologies for longer battery life</span> <span id=\"t=559.736\" data-timecode=\"559.736\">and greater performance.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=561.566\" data-timecode=\"561.566\">And of course, new and improved apps.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=564.326\" data-timecode=\"564.326\">Just since its release in October we've installed</span> <span id=\"t=567.866\" data-timecode=\"567.866\">over 40 million copies of Mavericks.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=571.586\" data-timecode=\"571.586\">This is the most of a single release ever in Apple's history.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=577.266\" data-timecode=\"577.266\">Also, that makes over 50 percent of our installed base working</span> <span id=\"t=584.896\" data-timecode=\"584.896\">on our latest operating system.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=588.386\" data-timecode=\"588.386\">This is the fastest adoption ever</span> <span id=\"t=591.576\" data-timecode=\"591.576\">of any PC operating system in history.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=596.416\" data-timecode=\"596.416\">Now, you may wonder how that compares to Windows.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=601.016\" data-timecode=\"601.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=602.066\" data-timecode=\"602.066\">I knew somebody was going to ask so I decided to make a chart.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=606.016\" data-timecode=\"606.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=607.476\" data-timecode=\"607.476\">Well, as it turns out Windows 8 shipped</span> <span id=\"t=611.146\" data-timecode=\"611.146\">about a year before Mavericks and it's at 14 percent.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=617.516\" data-timecode=\"617.516\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=620.376\" data-timecode=\"620.376\">Need I say more?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=622.516\" data-timecode=\"622.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=629.086\" data-timecode=\"629.086\">So, we could not be happier with Mavericks and the momentum</span> <span id=\"t=633.716\" data-timecode=\"633.716\">of the Mac, but of course we're always future focused.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=638.386\" data-timecode=\"638.386\">And today, to talk about the future of OS X,</span> <span id=\"t=641.886\" data-timecode=\"641.886\">I'd like to invite my colleague up, Craig Federighi,</span> <span id=\"t=645.106\" data-timecode=\"645.106\">to tell us all about it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=646.276\" data-timecode=\"646.276\">Craig.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=647.516\" data-timecode=\"647.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=652.506\" data-timecode=\"652.506\">Good morning.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=653.566\" data-timecode=\"653.566\">Wow.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=656.516\" data-timecode=\"656.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=661.276\" data-timecode=\"661.276\">Well, it's wonderful to be here presenting among the greatest</span> <span id=\"t=665.576\" data-timecode=\"665.576\">developers collected in the world.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=668.006\" data-timecode=\"668.006\">You guys are fantastic.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=669.676\" data-timecode=\"669.676\">You know, it was just a year ago, here at WWDC,</span> <span id=\"t=673.176\" data-timecode=\"673.176\">when we narrowly averted a major OS X naming crisis.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=679.016\" data-timecode=\"679.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=680.756\" data-timecode=\"680.756\">You may remember that we're able to deftly shift from names based</span> <span id=\"t=685.036\" data-timecode=\"685.036\">on big cats to names based on beautiful places in California,</span> <span id=\"t=690.236\" data-timecode=\"690.236\">starting of course with OS X Mavericks.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=693.836\" data-timecode=\"693.836\">Well, it's another year and time for another name</span> <span id=\"t=697.796\" data-timecode=\"697.796\">and so we collected our crack product marketing team,</span> <span id=\"t=702.566\" data-timecode=\"702.566\">shoved them in their VW Minibus and set them out on the road.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=707.446\" data-timecode=\"707.446\">Now, they first ventured south discovering OS X, Oxnard.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=712.016\" data-timecode=\"712.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=713.936\" data-timecode=\"713.936\">This wasn't quite right.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=715.606\" data-timecode=\"715.606\">But undeterred, they headed east,</span> <span id=\"t=718.976\" data-timecode=\"718.976\">landed in OS X Rancho Cucamonga.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=722.306\" data-timecode=\"722.306\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=724.596\" data-timecode=\"724.596\">Still, we hadn't quite hit the mark.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=727.026\" data-timecode=\"727.026\">So, they boldly ventured north landing at OS X Weed.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=734.016\" data-timecode=\"734.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=735.296\" data-timecode=\"735.296\">Now</span> <span id=\"t=736.516\" data-timecode=\"736.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=741.756\" data-timecode=\"741.756\">Strangely, this one had large pockets of support</span> <span id=\"t=744.376\" data-timecode=\"744.376\">within the product marketing organization,</span> <span id=\"t=746.216\" data-timecode=\"746.216\">but saner heads did prevail and they set off</span> <span id=\"t=750.946\" data-timecode=\"750.946\">on what then was somewhat more circuitous path.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=754.556\" data-timecode=\"754.556\">It took them ultimately to a place</span> <span id=\"t=756.316\" data-timecode=\"756.316\">that embodies the beauty and power of OS X.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=760.366\" data-timecode=\"760.366\">We discovered OS X Yosemite.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=764.516\" data-timecode=\"764.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=774.856\" data-timecode=\"774.856\">Now, Yosemite is a fantastic new release with a new interface,</span> <span id=\"t=780.346\" data-timecode=\"780.346\">big enhancements to our most popular apps</span> <span id=\"t=783.526\" data-timecode=\"783.526\">and something all knew, we call Continuity.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=787.406\" data-timecode=\"787.406\">Now, I want to start with design.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=790.406\" data-timecode=\"790.406\">OS X, of course started with the bold design of Aqua.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=795.676\" data-timecode=\"795.676\">And over the years, it's evolved</span> <span id=\"t=798.406\" data-timecode=\"798.406\">to the refined look we all loved today in Mavericks.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=803.146\" data-timecode=\"803.146\">Well, with Yosemite, we continue this evolution and I'd</span> <span id=\"t=807.266\" data-timecode=\"807.266\">like to give you a look at where we're headed.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=812.516\" data-timecode=\"812.516\">[ Music ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=868.456\" data-timecode=\"868.456\">How about that?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=870.516\" data-timecode=\"870.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=876.616\" data-timecode=\"876.616\">I think the team has done some remarkable work.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=879.536\" data-timecode=\"879.536\">You know, we started with the most fundamental controls,</span> <span id=\"t=883.206\" data-timecode=\"883.206\">focused always on clarity, as well as utility.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=888.626\" data-timecode=\"888.626\">We refined the tool bars and the window materials</span> <span id=\"t=893.226\" data-timecode=\"893.226\">and the window constructions.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=895.216\" data-timecode=\"895.216\">If you look at the window title bar, you'll see how the use</span> <span id=\"t=897.896\" data-timecode=\"897.896\">of translucent materials gives you a sense of place</span> <span id=\"t=900.366\" data-timecode=\"900.366\">as you scroll your content.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=902.686\" data-timecode=\"902.686\">Now, these same carefully crafted translucent materials</span> <span id=\"t=905.856\" data-timecode=\"905.856\">are used in the sidebars.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=907.716\" data-timecode=\"907.716\">So now, your windows take on the personality of your desktop.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=912.756\" data-timecode=\"912.756\">As you change your desktop picture, your window adapts</span> <span id=\"t=916.236\" data-timecode=\"916.236\">to reflect that personality and that temperature.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=919.426\" data-timecode=\"919.426\">And the translucency also helps maintain a sense of depth</span> <span id=\"t=923.336\" data-timecode=\"923.336\">and place as you move your windows over one another.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=928.246\" data-timecode=\"928.246\">Now, we also use the same gorgeous translucent material</span> <span id=\"t=931.816\" data-timecode=\"931.816\">for the dock and check out these beautifully crafted new icons.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=937.056\" data-timecode=\"937.056\">So clean and yet so fundamentally still Mac.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=940.316\" data-timecode=\"940.316\">And check out the trash can, that is a gorgeous trash can.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=945.076\" data-timecode=\"945.076\">You wouldn't believe how much time we spent crafting a</span> <span id=\"t=947.246\" data-timecode=\"947.246\">trash can.</span> </p>\n<p

Markup.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1580.526\" data-timecode=\"1580.526\">Have you ever been working on an email message and you realized</span> <span id=\"t=1583.626\" data-timecode=\"1583.626\">that if you could just maybe circle something</span> <span id=\"t=1586.106\" data-timecode=\"1586.106\">or write something on the message,</span> <span id=\"t=1587.676\" data-timecode=\"1587.676\">maybe do a little something, you can get your point</span> <span id=\"t=1589.606\" data-timecode=\"1589.606\">across so much more clearly, well, now with Markup you can.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1593.136\" data-timecode=\"1593.136\">It burns right back in to your mail message,</span> <span id=\"t=1596.316\" data-timecode=\"1596.316\">and it even works with PDFs.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1598.536\" data-timecode=\"1598.536\">So if you needed, for instance, sign a PDF, you can now do</span> <span id=\"t=1601.656\" data-timecode=\"1601.656\">that with your iSight camera</span> <span id=\"t=1602.836\" data-timecode=\"1602.836\">or even drawing your signature right on the trackpad</span> <span id=\"t=1605.376\" data-timecode=\"1605.376\">and it goes right into the email message</span> <span id=\"t=1607.346\" data-timecode=\"1607.346\">and you can send on its way.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1609.076\" data-timecode=\"1609.076\">It's going to be super handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1611.196\" data-timecode=\"1611.196\">Next. Great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1614.696\" data-timecode=\"1614.696\">I love it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1618.056\" data-timecode=\"1618.056\">Next up. Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1620.136\" data-timecode=\"1620.136\">We've in Yosemite been able to pack all the power</span> <span id=\"t=1623.016\" data-timecode=\"1623.016\">of the Safari UI into this single bar,</span> <span id=\"t=1626.736\" data-timecode=\"1626.736\">and that means you have more space for your content.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1630.796\" data-timecode=\"1630.796\">Now, of course, you may wonder what happened</span> <span id=\"t=1632.546\" data-timecode=\"1632.546\">on my Favorites bar.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1634.386\" data-timecode=\"1634.386\">Well, of course, you can bring that back if you want to.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1637.276\" data-timecode=\"1637.276\">But in Yosemite you don't really need</span> <span id=\"t=1639.206\" data-timecode=\"1639.206\">to because now your Smart Search Field</span> <span id=\"t=1642.126\" data-timecode=\"1642.126\">when you click it shows you all of your favorites right there.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1645.946\" data-timecode=\"1645.946\">And it's also really great for search.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1647.936\" data-timecode=\"1647.936\">So in addition, when you type to get</span> <span id=\"t=1649.246\" data-timecode=\"1649.246\">in your smart search suggestions,</span> <span id=\"t=1651.116\" data-timecode=\"1651.116\">you also get spotlight suggestions right there</span> <span id=\"t=1654.566\" data-timecode=\"1654.566\">in your completion menu.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1655.646\" data-timecode=\"1655.646\">And this means, you can get things faster than ever before.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1659.706\" data-timecode=\"1659.706\">Now, Safari is also more powerful than ever with sharing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1663.916\" data-timecode=\"1663.916\">So now, if you want to subscribe to an RSS feed on the site,</span> <span id=\"t=1667.996\" data-timecode=\"1667.996\">you can do that right here</span> <span id=\"t=1669.646\" data-timecode=\"1669.646\">and those RSS feed articles will show up right</span> <span id=\"t=1671.916\" data-timecode=\"1671.916\">in your Safari sidebar under Shared Links.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1674.836\" data-timecode=\"1674.836\">And you can also share to people more quickly than ever,</span> <span id=\"t=1678.486\" data-timecode=\"1678.486\">because Safari lists the people you've message</span> <span id=\"t=1680.316\" data-timecode=\"1680.316\">with most recently, and with just one click you can share</span> <span id=\"t=1683.776\" data-timecode=\"1683.776\">a webpage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1685.536\" data-timecode=\"1685.536\">Now, Safari is better than ever as well with tabs.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1689.996\" data-timecode=\"1689.996\">We now have a tab view that gives you a bird's-eye glance</span> <span id=\"t=1693.726\" data-timecode=\"1693.726\">of all of your tabs and it stacks tabs from sites just</span> <span id=\"t=1698.066\" data-timecode=\"1698.066\">like this so you get individual stacks</span> <span id=\"t=1700.076\" data-timecode=\"1700.076\">for each site that you're browsing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1703.376\" data-timecode=\"1703.376\">Safari is also great when it comes to privacy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1706.196\" data-timecode=\"1706.196\">Safari was the first browser to introduce private browsing</span> <span id=\"t=1709.196\" data-timecode=\"1709.196\">and now it's easier than ever,</span> <span id=\"t=1710.896\" data-timecode=\"1710.896\">because you can create a new private window.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1713.746\" data-timecode=\"1713.746\">And when you do, all the content within that window</span> <span id=\"t=1716.796\" data-timecode=\"1716.796\">and all its tabs stay private and all</span> <span id=\"t=1719.586\" data-timecode=\"1719.586\">of your other windows are unaffected.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1722.506\" data-timecode=\"1722.506\">It's really handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1724.066\" data-timecode=\"1724.066\">Now, Safari is great when it comes to standards.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1727.366\" data-timecode=\"1727.366\">It has WebGL now for superfast 3D graphics,</span> <span id=\"t=1731.246\" data-timecode=\"1731.246\">SPDY for efficient networking, and HTML Premium Video.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1736.456\" data-timecode=\"1736.456\">Now, this enables modern Macs to efficiently stream video</span> <span id=\"t=1741.346\" data-timecode=\"1741.346\">from site like Netflix without a plug-in</span> <span id=\"t=1743.726\" data-timecode=\"1743.726\">and the results are awesome.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1746.176\" data-timecode=\"1746.176\">You get up to two hours longer battery life</span> <span id=\"t=1749.376\" data-timecode=\"1749.376\">on a MacBook Air streaming Netflix.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1751.606\" data-timecode=\"1751.606\">And that's for 1080P video.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1754.296\" data-timecode=\"1754.296\">Now, Safari has been set the benchmark really</span> <span id=\"t=1757.766\" data-timecode=\"1757.766\">for energy efficiency since Mavericks</span> <span id=\"t=1760.536\" data-timecode=\"1760.536\">and its lead here continues.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1762.886\" data-timecode=\"1762.886\">When it comes to multi-tab browser energy efficiency,</span> <span id=\"t=1766.306\" data-timecode=\"1766.306\">Safari is without equal.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1768.276\" data-timecode=\"1768.276\">And when it comes to the kind of UI manipulations</span> <span id=\"t=1770.556\" data-timecode=\"1770.556\">that are typical in web apps, Safari is faster than ever.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1775.386\" data-timecode=\"1775.386\">And how about JavaScript?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1776.946\" data-timecode=\"1776.946\">Well, take the most complex kind of JavaScript that's typical</span> <span id=\"t=1779.936\" data-timecode=\"1779.936\">of very rich web applications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1782.306\" data-timecode=\"1782.306\">Well, Safari now has a Fourth Tier LLVM-based optimized</span> <span id=\"t=1787.466\" data-timecode=\"1787.466\">JavaScript Compiler that is the fastest of any major browser.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1792.346\" data-timecode=\"1792.346\">And when it comes to typical website JavaScript,</span> <span id=\"t=1797.226\" data-timecode=\"1797.226\">Safari is in a league of its own.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1799.976\" data-timecode=\"1799.976\">So of that is Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1801.046\" data-timecode=\"1801.046\">And to give you a quick demo, I'd like to bring</span> <span id=\"t=1803.516\" data-timecode=\"1803.516\">up Brian Crowe to the stage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1805.176\" data-timecode=\"1805.176\">Let's give him a big welcome.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1805.826\" data-timecode=\"1805.826\">Brian.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=1806.516\" data-timecode=\"1806.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1811.696\" data-timecode=\"1811.696\">Thanks Craig.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1814.036\" data-timecode=\"1814.036\">I'm really happy to be here today.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1816.276\" data-timecode=\"1816.276\">So, I'm just going to dive right into Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1819.066\" data-timecode=\"1819.066\">Here we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1820.296\" data-timecode=\"1820.296\">It's really great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1823.046\" data-timecode=\"1823.046\">And when you go to a website,</span> <span id=\"t=1826.326\" data-timecode=\"1826.326\">you can really appreciate the new design.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1829.166\" data-timecode=\"1829.166\">It's simpler and it's even more powerful.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1832.736\" data-timecode=\"1832.736\">I can open up the sidebar really easily to get at my Bookmarks,</span> <span id=\"t=1836.896\" data-timecode=\"1836.896\">my Reading List as well as my Shared Links.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1840.136\" data-timecode=\"1840.136\">And when I click into the Search field, I get instant access</span> <span id=\"t=1846.486\" data-timecode=\"1846.486\">to all my favorite sites.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1848.286\" data-timecode=\"1848.286\">It's really nice.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1849.756\" data-timecode=\"1849.756\">So, I'm going to go ahead and type</span> <span id=\"t=1850.966\" data-timecode=\"1850.966\">in a search for Ansel Adams.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1853.426\" data-timecode=\"1853.426\">There we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1854.926\" data-timecode=\"1854.926\">And if I hit return, I can just go</span> <span id=\"t=1857.266\" data-timecode=\"1857.266\">to a regular old Google search.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1859.806\" data-timecode=\"1859.806\">But, since Ansel Adams is a common search term,</span> <span id=\"t=1864.876\" data-timecode=\"1864.876\">I get this new Spotlight suggestion there at the top.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1868.716\" data-timecode=\"1868.716\">It has a snippet of information from Wikipedia.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1871.136\" data-timecode=\"1871.136\">I can read it there, or if I'd like I can go ahead</span> <span id=\"t=1874.916\" data-timecode=\"1874.916\">and see the entire article right on the Wikipedia site.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1878.786\" data-timecode=\"1878.786\">It's super convenient.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1881.256\" data-timecode=\"1881.256\">Now, if you use tabs, you're going to love this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1886.996\" data-timecode=\"1886.996\">Now, no matter how many tabs I have opened,</span> <span id=\"t=1890.556\" data-timecode=\"1890.556\">I can smoothly scroll through them to get at any</span> <span id=\"t=1893.946\" data-timecode=\"1893.946\">of that tab I'm looking for.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1895.616\" data-timecode=\"1895.616\">It's really nice.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=1897.091\" data-timecode=\"1897.091\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1899.166\" data-timecode=\"1899.166\">So now, sometimes I want to see my tabs so I can go ahead</span> <span id=\"t=1902.766\" data-timecode=\"1902.766\">and do this and I'll click on the new Tab View button.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1906.186\" data-timecode=\"1906.186\">And there you go, a beautiful bird's eye view</span> <span id=\"t=1909.066\" data-timecode=\"1909.066\">of all my open tabs.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1910.096\" data-timecode=\"1910.096\">So, I'm going to go ahead and select this one here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1913.566\" data-timecode=\"1913.566\">It's a photoblog with a bunch of pictures of Yosemite</span> <span id=\"t=1917.066\" data-timecode=\"1917.066\">and there's a couple of good ones of El Capitan down below.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1920.726\" data-timecode=\"1920.726\">So, I'll find in there El Capitan.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1922.816\" data-timecode=\"1922.816\">And then I'm going to choose this one.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1924.936\" data-timecode=\"1924.936\">Now, I want to share it with Craig so I'm going</span> <span id=\"t=1926.476\" data-timecode=\"1926.476\">to get the high-res image.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1928.036\" data-timecode=\"1928.036\">Now, sharing couldn't be easier in Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1930.596\" data-timecode=\"1930.596\">I just simply click on the Share button here,</span> <span id=\"t=1933.436\" data-timecode=\"1933.436\">and now I can use the new recent recipients feature</span> <span id=\"t=1936.776\" data-timecode=\"1936.776\">to address it to Craig.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1938.766\" data-timecode=\"1938.766\">And here we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1940.966\" data-timecode=\"1940.966\">And with just one click, I'm ready to send that image.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1944.736\" data-timecode=\"1944.736\">It's that easy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1946.536\" data-timecode=\"1946.536\">So But before I send it,</span> <span id=\"t=1948.976\" data-timecode=\"1948.976\">I'm going to add my two cents to this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1951.486\" data-timecode=\"1951.486\">So, I can go here and we have just the right feature</span> <span id=\"t=1953.996\" data-timecode=\"1953.996\">called Markup.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1955.576\" data-timecode=\"1955.576\">Now with Markup, I can edit this image</span> <span id=\"t=1958.536\" data-timecode=\"1958.536\">without ever even leaving Mail.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1960.916\" data-timecode=\"1960.916\">It's really great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1962.416\" data-timecode=\"1962.416\">So, what I'm going to do is annotate this image</span> <span

id=\"t=1970.546\" data-timecode=\"1970.546\">that it magnifies everything underneath it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1972.246\" data-timecode=\"1972.246\">So, I'm going to place it right here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1974.516\" data-timecode=\"1974.516\">And it turns out that those two specs</span> <span id=\"t=1977.666\" data-timecode=\"1977.666\">on the big granite face there, they're actually climbers.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1981.126\" data-timecode=\"1981.126\">It's kind of crazy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1981.936\" data-timecode=\"1981.936\">So, I'm going to zoom it a little more</span> <span id=\"t=1983.456\" data-timecode=\"1983.456\">so you can see it better.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1984.766\" data-timecode=\"1984.766\">There we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1986.356\" data-timecode=\"1986.356\">So, I can zoom nicely and place it here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1989.186\" data-timecode=\"1989.186\">Now, I want to point this out to Craig in the mail.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1992.546\" data-timecode=\"1992.546\">And I can use my trackpad to draw on the image.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1996.566\" data-timecode=\"1996.566\">So, I'm going to go ahead and draw an arrow here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=1999.166\" data-timecode=\"1999.166\">There we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2001.256\" data-timecode=\"2001.256\">And you notice Markup's smart enough to recognize the arrow</span> <span id=\"t=2005.076\" data-timecode=\"2005.076\">and make it really pretty.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2007.556\" data-timecode=\"2007.556\">So now now, it's really easy to add a comment.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2012.566\" data-timecode=\"2012.566\">And so, check out the climbers.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2016.586\" data-timecode=\"2016.586\">There we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2017.986\" data-timecode=\"2017.986\">Now, I can have a little fun with this, so I'm going</span> <span id=\"t=2021.496\" data-timecode=\"2021.496\">to go ahead and create a cartoon bubble, OK?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2025.006\" data-timecode=\"2025.006\">I'm not so good at drawing but Markup's going to help me.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2028.866\" data-timecode=\"2028.866\">There we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2030.736\" data-timecode=\"2030.736\">So, luckily you can clean that up [phonetic],</span> <span id=\"t=2032.096\" data-timecode=\"2032.096\">it's better than I am.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2033.526\" data-timecode=\"2033.526\">So now I can add a caption.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2036.086\" data-timecode=\"2036.086\">And so, I think I'm going to appeal</span> <span id=\"t=2037.826\" data-timecode=\"2037.826\">to the inner developer and all of us.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2039.706\" data-timecode=\"2039.706\">I'm going to type in \"I hope the rope is,\"</span> <span id=\"t=2045.976\" data-timecode=\"2045.976\">wait for it,

</p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2055.716\" data-timecode=\"2055.716\">OK. So, I think I've done enough to this picture.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2058.545\" data-timecode=\"2058.545\">Time to go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2061.545\" data-timecode=\"2061.545\">So, now it's ready for me to mail</span> <span id=\"t=2063.326\" data-timecode=\"2063.326\">and I can just click like that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2065.275\" data-timecode=\"2065.275\">So that's how easy it is to Markup an image in Mail.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2070.016\" data-timecode=\"2070.016\">So, those are just a couple</span> <span id=\"t=2071.275\" data-timecode=\"2071.275\">of great new features in Safari in Mail.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2074.545\" data-timecode=\"2074.545\">Thank you.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2075.516\" data-timecode=\"2075.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2083.755\" data-timecode=\"2083.755\">How about that parallel programming joke.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2085.525\" data-timecode=\"2085.525\">You did not see that coming.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2090.766\" data-timecode=\"2090.766\">Next, something entirely different.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2092.616\" data-timecode=\"2092.616\">It's called the Continuity.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2094.696\" data-timecode=\"2094.696\">So now at Apple, we believe you should be able</span> <span id=\"t=2096.946\" data-timecode=\"2096.946\">to use the right device for the moment.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2099.836\" data-timecode=\"2099.836\">Maybe your phone when you're on the go, your iPad when you want</span> <span id=\"t=2104.016\" data-timecode=\"2104.016\">to kick back on the couch, or maybe your Mac</span> <span id=\"t=2106.566\" data-timecode=\"2106.566\">when you're trying to get some work done.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2108.096\" data-timecode=\"2108.096\">But we also want the transitions between these moments</span> <span id=\"t=2112.186\" data-timecode=\"2112.186\">to be absolutely as natural and seamless as possible.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2116.836\" data-timecode=\"2116.836\">Now, our Continuity features start with something simple</span> <span id=\"t=2120.146\" data-timecode=\"2120.146\">and that's AirDrop, because now AirDrop works</span> <span id=\"t=2122.956\" data-timecode=\"2122.956\">between iOS and the Mac.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2124.516\" data-timecode=\"2124.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2132.606\" data-timecode=\"2132.606\">It's really convenient.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2135.156\" data-timecode=\"2135.156\">But now we have something that we really take it</span> <span id=\"t=2136.886\" data-timecode=\"2136.886\">to the next level and that's called Handoff.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2140.376\" data-timecode=\"2140.376\">So, it turns out now that when you're working on your Mac,</span> <span id=\"t=2145.966\" data-timecode=\"2145.966\">your devices around you in proximity are aware</span> <span id=\"t=2150.266\" data-timecode=\"2150.266\">of each other and aware of what you're up to.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2153.656\" data-timecode=\"2153.656\">And so, if you want to pick up where you left off on your Mac</span> <span id=\"t=2156.546\" data-timecode=\"2156.546\">and your iPad, your iPad is prompting you right</span> <span id=\"t=2159.766\" data-timecode=\"2159.766\">in the lower left of the screen.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2161.566\" data-timecode=\"2161.566\">Just swipe up and you can pick up working</span> <span id=\"t=2164.656\" data-timecode=\"2164.656\">on what you're working on your Mac right on your iPad.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2167.286\" data-timecode=\"2167.286\">And this</span> <span id=\"t=2169.516\" data-timecode=\"2169.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2174.356\" data-timecode=\"2174.356\">This works in the other direction as well.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2176.096\" data-timecode=\"2176.096\">So, let's say, you're composing an email on your phone</span> <span id=\"t=2180.636\" data-timecode=\"2180.636\">and you walk up to your Mac.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2182.636\" data-timecode=\"2182.636\">Well, your Mac will notice what you're doing</span> <span id=\"t=2184.766\" data-timecode=\"2184.766\">and prompt you right on the dock.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2186.966\" data-timecode=\"2186.966\">You click it and you can pick up finishing</span> <span id=\"t=2189.336\" data-timecode=\"2189.336\">that message right on your Mac.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2191.516\" data-timecode=\"2191.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2198.246\" data-timecode=\"2198.246\">Now, we've been able to take this same proximity awareness</span> <span id=\"t=2202.376\" data-timecode=\"2202.376\">and make the process of creating a hotspot easier</span> <span id=\"t=2205.306\" data-timecode=\"2205.306\">than ever before.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2206.856\" data-timecode=\"2206.856\">So now, if you're using your Mac and you're away from a network</span> <span id=\"t=2209.556\" data-timecode=\"2209.556\">but your phone is nearby, when you go up to your Wi-Fi menu,</span> <span id=\"t=2213.406\" data-timecode=\"2213.406\">your Mac, actually without any configuration ever have been</span> <span id=\"t=2216.226\" data-timecode=\"2216.226\">done on your phone, sees your phone and prompts you</span> <span id=\"t=2219.986\" data-timecode=\"2219.986\">so you click it and it automatically sets up a hotspot.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2222.836\" data-timecode=\"2222.836\">You never type a password and you're</span> <span id=\"t=2224.236\" data-timecode=\"2224.236\">on the network that easily.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2226.516\" data-timecode=\"2226.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2231.656\" data-timecode=\"2231.656\">And this works even if your phone is</span> <span id=\"t=2233.466\" data-timecode=\"2233.466\">across the room sitting in a handbag.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2235.316\" data-timecode=\"2235.316\">You just never have to touch it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2237.426\" data-timecode=\"2237.426\">Now, the next that we really wanted to handle is SMS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2241.686\" data-timecode=\"2241.686\">Now, we all love iMessage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2245.126\" data-timecode=\"2245.126\">We can continue our conversations seamlessly</span> <span id=\"t=2247.136\" data-timecode=\"2247.136\">from device to device but then we have these green</span> <span id=\"t=2250.296\" data-timecode=\"2250.296\">bubble friends.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2251.976\" data-timecode=\"2251.976\">And, you know, they have inferior devices and they insist</span> <span id=\"t=2257.956\" data-timecode=\"2257.956\">on sending us messages, and we don't want</span> <span id=\"t=2259.596\" data-timecode=\"2259.596\">to hold it against them.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2260.406\" data-timecode=\"2260.406\">But the problem is that those messages don't show</span> <span id=\"t=2263.586\" data-timecode=\"2263.586\">up on our other devices until now, because now</span> <span id=\"t=2269.036\" data-timecode=\"2269.036\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2271.056\" data-timecode=\"2271.056\">your phone is able to access or relay to automatically</span> <span id=\"t=2276.196\" data-timecode=\"2276.196\">and transparently send your messages between devices.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2279.716\" data-timecode=\"2279.716\">Now, believe it or not,</span> <span id=\"t=2281.206\" data-timecode=\"2281.206\">we're able to do the same thing with phone calls.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2285.566\" data-timecode=\"2285.566\">So now, when you receive a phone call,</span> <span id=\"t=2289.666\" data-timecode=\"2289.666\">your Mac gives you caller ID and you can even accept the call</span> <span id=\"t=2294.316\" data-timecode=\"2294.316\">and use your Mac as a speaker phone.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2297.516\" data-timecode=\"2297.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2307.076\" data-timecode=\"2307.076\">And believe

data-timecode=\"2312.846\">You never have to miss a call.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2315.586\" data-timecode=\"2315.586\">Well, now that your Mac is all phone savvy,</span> <span id=\"t=2319.256\" data-timecode=\"2319.256\">it's also a great way to dial the phone.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2321.536\" data-timecode=\"2321.536\">So, if you're in Contacts and you want to dial a number,</span> <span id=\"t=2324.176\" data-timecode=\"2324.176\">you can do it right there.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2325.756\" data-timecode=\"2325.756\">And even on a webpage, you see a number you want to

id=\"t=2676.986\" data-timecode=\"2676.986\">We've now sold well over 800 million iOS devices and each</span> <span id=\"t=2684.146\" data-timecode=\"2684.146\">of the categories of devices has set its own significant sales</span> <span id=\"t=2687.936\" data-timecode=\"2687.936\">record in the past year.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2690.036\" data-timecode=\"2690.036\">iPod Touch has passed 100 million units.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2694.686\" data-timecode=\"2694.686\">iPad has passed 200 million units.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2698.716\" data-timecode=\"2698.716\">And iPhone has passed half a billion units.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2703.606\" data-timecode=\"2703.606\">This is incredible.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2705.536\" data-timecode=\"2705.536\">But what's even more impressive is how many new customers</span> <span id=\"t=2710.556\" data-timecode=\"2710.556\">to Apple that iOS devices has brought to us.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2715.546\" data-timecode=\"2715.546\">Over 130 million customers who bought an iOS device</span> <span id=\"t=2722.076\" data-timecode=\"2722.076\">in the past 12 months was buying their first Apple device.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2728.516\" data-timecode=\"2728.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2734.616\" data-timecode=\"2734.616\">Now, many of these customers were switchers from Android.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2742.556\" data-timecode=\"2742.556\">They had bought an Android phone by mistake.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2748.111\" data-timecode=\"2748.111\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2750.206\" data-timecode=\"2750.206\">And then had sought a better experience and a better life.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2756.221\" data-timecode=\"2756.221\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2758.426\" data-timecode=\"2758.426\">And decided to check out iPhone and iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2763.836\" data-timecode=\"2763.836\">Nearly, in fact, nearly half of our customers in China</span> <span id=\"t=2769.626\" data-timecode=\"2769.626\">in the past six months switched from Android to iPhone.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2775.836\" data-timecode=\"2775.836\">This is incredible and of course</span> <span id=\"t=2777.946\" data-timecode=\"2777.946\">that better experience is our devices in iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2782.786\" data-timecode=\"2782.786\">And iOS 7 took that experience to even higher level.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2787.656\" data-timecode=\"2787.656\">The customer sat with iOS 7 is really off the charts.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2793.406\" data-timecode=\"2793.406\">Change wave recently measured it at 97 percent.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2798.656\" data-timecode=\"2798.656\">These are customer sat ratings that no one gets.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2803.276\" data-timecode=\"2803.276\">It's really enormous.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2806.026\" data-timecode=\"2806.026\">Now, one of the reasons why customers say they love iOS is</span> <span id=\"t=2813.806\" data-timecode=\"2813.806\">that we make available our software updates</span> <span id=\"t=2818.036\" data-timecode=\"2818.036\">for the OS available to as many customers as possible.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2822.886\" data-timecode=\"2822.886\">And, if you look at what has happened with iOS 7,</span> <span id=\"t=2827.416\" data-timecode=\"2827.416\">our latest release, almost 9 out of 10 people</span> <span id=\"t=2831.856\" data-timecode=\"2831.856\">in our install base are running our latest operating system.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2836.516\" data-timecode=\"2836.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2842.936\" data-timecode=\"2842.936\">Now, this is in stark contrast to Android.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2846.436\" data-timecode=\"2846.436\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2848.856\" data-timecode=\"2848.856\">If you look at their latest release, less than one out of 10</span> <span id=\"t=2853.406\" data-timecode=\"2853.406\">of their customers are on their latest software.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2857.636\" data-timecode=\"2857.636\">And, if you look at a broader group, over a third</span> <span id=\"t=2863.706\" data-timecode=\"2863.706\">of their customers are running a version</span> <span id=\"t=2867.006\" data-timecode=\"2867.006\">of Android from four years ago.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2872.276\" data-timecode=\"2872.276\">That's like ancient history.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2874.516\" data-timecode=\"2874.516\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2877.626\" data-timecode=\"2877.626\">Now, that means that these customers are not getting great</span> <span id=\"t=2882.626\" data-timecode=\"2882.626\">new features.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2884.456\" data-timecode=\"2884.456\">They're not able to run your latest apps.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2888.116\" data-timecode=\"2888.116\">And, they don't get security updates</span> <span id=\"t=2891.616\" data-timecode=\"2891.616\">that they may need to stay safe.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2895.146\" data-timecode=\"2895.146\">And, this is particularly important for Android</span> <span id=\"t=2898.536\" data-timecode=\"2898.536\">which dominates the mobile malware market.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2901.516\" data-timecode=\"2901.516\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2904.636\" data-timecode=\"2904.636\">No wonder experts are saying things like this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2909.436\" data-timecode=\"2909.436\">Android fragmentation is turning devices</span> <span id=\"t=2911.936\" data-timecode=\"2911.936\">into a toxic hell stew of vulnerabilities.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2917.196\" data-timecode=\"2917.196\">Now, fortunately, iOS hasn't had this kind of issues</span> <span id=\"t=2924.626\" data-timecode=\"2924.626\">because we do everything we can to make our updates available</span> <span id=\"t=2929.136\" data-timecode=\"2929.136\">to as many people as possible.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2931.946\" data-timecode=\"2931.946\">So, we could not be happier with iOS 7</span> <span id=\"t=2938.446\" data-timecode=\"2938.446\">and the momentum of iOS devices.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2940.726\" data-timecode=\"2940.726\">But, we are not standing still.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2945.146\" data-timecode=\"2945.146\">Today, we're announcing iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2948.516\" data-timecode=\"2948.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2956.056\" data-timecode=\"2956.056\">And, iOS 8 is a giant release</span> <span id=\"t=2959.936\" data-timecode=\"2959.936\">and it's really two stories not one.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2963.266\" data-timecode=\"2963.266\">It has great end user features.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2967.536\" data-timecode=\"2967.536\">But, it also has incredible developer features</span> <span id=\"t=2972.376\" data-timecode=\"2972.376\">so you can extend your experience and build apps</span> <span id=\"t=2976.896\" data-timecode=\"2976.896\">that you couldn't do before.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2979.796\" data-timecode=\"2979.796\">We'd like to get started with describing it with talking</span> <span id=\"t=2983.336\" data-timecode=\"2983.336\">about the end user features.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2985.456\" data-timecode=\"2985.456\">And, to do that, I'd like to bring Craig back</span> <span id=\"t=2988.256\" data-timecode=\"2988.256\">up to the stage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2988.636\" data-timecode=\"2988.636\">Craig?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=2989.516\" data-timecode=\"2989.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2997.046\" data-timecode=\"2997.046\">I missed you guys.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=2998.706\" data-timecode=\"2998.706\">So, what? Let's talk about iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3003.296\" data-timecode=\"3003.296\">Now, iOS 8 of course builds on the design of iOS 7</span> <span id=\"t=3008.536\" data-timecode=\"3008.536\">with enhancements for both iPhone and iPad.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3012.166\" data-timecode=\"3012.166\">And, let's start with the phone.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3014.336\" data-timecode=\"3014.336\">Now, in iOS 8, we've refined notification center.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3018.706\" data-timecode=\"3018.706\">But, what I really love are our new interactive notifications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3024.186\" data-timecode=\"3024.186\">So now, if you get a message like this, just pull down</span> <span id=\"t=3028.506\" data-timecode=\"3028.506\">and you can reply from right where you are.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3031.036\" data-timecode=\"3031.036\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3033.056\" data-timecode=\"3033.056\">You don't have to leave the app you're in.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3034.706\" data-timecode=\"3034.706\">And this works for all kinds of notifications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3037.546\" data-timecode=\"3037.546\">If you get a calendar event for instance, just pull down</span> <span id=\"t=3040.316\" data-timecode=\"3040.316\">and respond and it works on the lock screen.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3044.166\" data-timecode=\"3044.166\">So, you can just swipe across in the lock screen.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3046.276\" data-timecode=\"3046.276\">You get those action buttons tapped</span> <span id=\"t=3048.166\" data-timecode=\"3048.166\">and you've dealt with it right there.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3050.836\" data-timecode=\"3050.836\">Now, in iOS 7, we gave you quick double-tap access to get</span> <span id=\"t=3054.966\" data-timecode=\"3054.966\">at your most recent apps.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3056.936\" data-timecode=\"3056.936\">Well now, you can also use that same double tap to get</span> <span id=\"t=3060.386\" data-timecode=\"3060.386\">at the people you communicate with most frequently.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3063.996\" data-timecode=\"3063.996\">It's really handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3065.676\" data-timecode=\"3065.676\">And, in iOS 7, we introduce this great Tab View in Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3070.636\" data-timecode=\"3070.636\">Well, we're bringing a great Tab View to iPad as well</span> <span id=\"t=3073.916\" data-timecode=\"3073.916\">with this bird's eye view of all of your tabs.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3077.106\" data-timecode=\"3077.106\">And, Safari also picks up the Side Bar that we love</span> <span id=\"t=3081.156\" data-timecode=\"3081.156\">in Yosemite with access to your bookmarks, your reading list</span> <span id=\"t=3084.926\" data-timecode=\"3084.926\">and your shared links.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3086.676\" data-timecode=\"3086.676\">Now, we've made managing your mail easier than ever before.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3090.406\" data-timecode=\"3090.406\">So now, if you're reading a message, you want to remember</span> <span id=\"t=3092.566\" data-timecode=\"3092.566\">to get back to it so you're going to mark it on red.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3094.606\" data-timecode=\"3094.606\">We can do that with just a single gesture.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3097.356\" data-timecode=\"3097.356\">And, if you want to flag a message,</span> <span id=\"t=3099.576\" data-timecode=\"3099.576\">you can just pull across, there's a flag option.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3101.306\" data-timecode=\"3101.306\">But, if you pull all the way across,</span> <span id=\"t=3103.006\" data-timecode=\"3103.006\">you can delete with just a gesture.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3105.656\" data-timecode=\"3105.656\">But the piece I love the best is what we've done</span> <span id=\"t=3108.396\" data-timecode=\"3108.396\">with composing messages.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3109.966\" data-timecode=\"3109.966\">Have you ever found yourself composing an email</span> <span id=\"t=3112.416\" data-timecode=\"3112.416\">and then you really wish like you get at something else</span> <span id=\"t=3115.006\" data-timecode=\"3115.006\">in your inbox maybe for that reply?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3117.686\" data-timecode=\"3117.686\">Well now, you can.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3118.626\" data-timecode=\"3118.626\">Just swipe that message down and you have access</span> <span id=\"t=3121.946\" data-timecode=\"3121.946\">to the rest of your mail.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3123.516\" data-timecode=\"3123.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3129.666\" data-timecode=\"3129.666\">So, I'd like to give you a demo of some</span> <span id=\"t=3131.116\" data-timecode=\"3131.116\">of these great iOS 8 enhancements now.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3136.976\" data-timecode=\"3136.976\">So, here we are on our iOS 8 lock screen.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3142.546\" data-timecode=\"3142.546\">And, if I receive a notification,</span> <span id=\"t=3144.426\" data-timecode=\"3144.426\">it looks like I happen to get one just right then,</span> <span id=\"t=3146.806\" data-timecode=\"3146.806\">I can swipe across and you see I have action so I can accept</span> <span id=\"t=3150.756\" data-timecode=\"3150.756\">or decline this meeting right here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3152.046\" data-timecode=\"3152.046\">And, of course, I'm going to use the device,</span> <span id=\"t=3155.466\" data-timecode=\"3155.466\">if I'm in here maybe playing some music here on iTunes radio,</span> <span id=\"t=3159.826\" data-timecode=\"3159.826\">I might get a notification.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3163.116\" data-timecode=\"3163.116\">And, if I do get notification, I can just swipe down on it, too.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3167.356\" data-timecode=\"3167.356\">So, here's one, just swipe down.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3169.766\" data-timecode=\"3169.766\">Now, I get access to my keyboard.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3171.836\" data-timecode=\"3171.836\">I can type right there.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3174.396\" data-timecode=\"3174.396\">Now, this works great for third party apps as well.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3177.166\" data-timecode=\"3177.166\">So, for instance, looks like I got tagged on Facebook,</span> <span id=\"t=3180.446\" data-timecode=\"3180.446\">I can like it right here with an actionable notification.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3184.416\" data-timecode=\"3184.416\">And, sometimes, you receive notifications</span> <span id=\"t=3186.066\" data-timecode=\"3186.066\">that you just really don't want deal with right now</span> <span id=\"t=3187.876\" data-timecode=\"3187.876\">and you can just flick those away like that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3191.256\" data-timecode=\"3191.256\">That's really handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3192.626\" data-timecode=\"3192.626\">Now, we've made getting at people easier than ever before.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3195.776\" data-timecode=\"3195.776\">So, if I just double-tap my Home button,</span> <span id=\"t=3197.366\" data-timecode=\"3197.366\">so I have all the people I most recently communicated with.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3200.776\" data-timecode=\"3200.776\">I swipe to the side and I have access to all my favorites.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3204.456\" data-timecode=\"3204.456\">If I tap on one, I have controls here to give them a phone call,</span> <span id=\"t=3208.476\" data-timecode=\"3208.476\">iMessage them or even FaceTime right here</span> <span id=\"t=3212.246\" data-timecode=\"3212.246\">with just a double-tap on the Home button.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3215.386\" data-timecode=\"3215.386\">It's really handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3217.036\" data-timecode=\"3217.036\">Now, I want to show you some</span> <span id=\"t=3218.086\" data-timecode=\"3218.086\">of the enhancements we made to mail.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3220.586\" data-timecode=\"3220.586\">Let's go take a look an iPad actually this time.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3224.336\" data-timecode=\"3224.336\">So, here we are on iPad.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3225.226\" data-timecode=\"3225.226\">I'm going to launch mail.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3227.916\" data-timecode=\"3227.916\">Now, I have a number of unread messages here</span> <span id=\"t=3230.446\" data-timecode=\"3230.446\">so let's work our way through them.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3232.156\" data-timecode=\"3232.156\">Here's a message from Open Table with a dinner appointment.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3236.516\" data-timecode=\"3236.516\">And, you notice that the reservation is actually called</span> <span id=\"t=3241.196\" data-timecode=\"3241.196\">out right here on the top.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3242.556\" data-timecode=\"3242.556\">Mail has actually given me an intelligent suggestion here</span> <span id=\"t=3245.066\" data-timecode=\"3245.066\">to add it to my calendar.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3246.096\" data-timecode=\"3246.096\">I can tap Add and just like this, it lets</span> <span id=\"t=3248.806\" data-timecode=\"3248.806\">it prompts me to fill out and add an event to my calendar.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3252.456\" data-timecode=\"3252.456\">That's really handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3254.116\" data-timecode=\"3254.116\">Now, sometimes, you get a message like this</span> <span id=\"t=3256.346\" data-timecode=\"3256.346\">where you're going to have to do some thinking about it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3258.156\" data-timecode=\"3258.156\">Maybe get back to it later.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3259.456\" data-timecode=\"3259.456\">Well now, with just a single swipe, I can mark it as unread.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3263.846\" data-timecode=\"3263.846\">It's really cool.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3265.236\" data-timecode=\"3265.236\">You can also flag really easily.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3267.176\" data-timecode=\"3267.176\">So, this is a message I want to flag.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3269.276\" data-timecode=\"3269.276\">Just flick it across and flag.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3272.606\" data-timecode=\"3272.606\">Now, here's a nice message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3273.926\" data-timecode=\"3273.926\">I don't know who this fellow is but he says great collaboration.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3277.216\" data-timecode=\"3277.216\">You and Johnny have really come together really well.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3280.246\" data-timecode=\"3280.246\">Let's take a look at that one.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3282.356\" data-timecode=\"3282.356\">Oh, dear God.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3283.016\" data-timecode=\"3283.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3284.306\" data-timecode=\"3284.306\">Well, this would be a good time</span> <span id=\"t=3285.466\" data-timecode=\"3285.466\">to demonstrate our quick delete feature.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3287.846\" data-timecode=\"3287.846\">So, I can drag all the way across and delete at a glance.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3290.996\" data-timecode=\"3290.996\">I'm certain that message won't haunt me</span> <span id=\"t=3292.716\" data-timecode=\"3292.716\">on the internet for years to come.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3295.626\" data-timecode=\"3295.626\">So, let's talk about composing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3296.786\" data-timecode=\"3296.786\">I got a message here from a friend who's visiting in town,</span> <span id=\"t=3300.286\" data-timecode=\"3300.286\">who's looking for a good restaurant.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3301.386\" data-timecode=\"3301.386\">So, I'll start replying to this message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3303.856\" data-timecode=\"3303.856\">And, I'll say, let's see check out and then, you know,</span> <span id=\"t=3308.226\" data-timecode=\"3308.226\">actually I got a good recommendation</span> <span id=\"t=3309.936\" data-timecode=\"3309.936\">from another friend here in my inbox,</span> <span id=\"t=3311.336\" data-timecode=\"3311.336\">so I'd like to get to that now.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3312.656\" data-timecode=\"3312.656\">Well, I can just swipe this draft down like this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3316.846\" data-timecode=\"3316.846\">Go right into another place, another message</span> <span id=\"t=3318.956\" data-timecode=\"3318.956\">in my inbox, tap out a selection.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3323.086\" data-timecode=\"3323.086\">That looks like exactly what I want to send him</span> <span id=\"t=3324.756\" data-timecode=\"3324.756\">so I'll just copy that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3325.806\" data-timecode=\"3325.806\">And now, with a tap at the bottom,</span> <span id=\"t=3327.396\" data-timecode=\"3327.396\">I restore my draft just like that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3330.656\" data-timecode=\"3330.656\">I can paste and send it on its way.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3333.446\" data-timecode=\"3333.446\">I think we're all going to love doing mail this way.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3336.316\" data-timecode=\"3336.316\">That's a quick look, few enhancements to iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3339.516\" data-timecode=\"3339.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3344.176\" data-timecode=\"3344.176\">So, let's talk about Spotlight.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3346.406\" data-timecode=\"3346.406\">And of course, Spotlight is a super convenient way</span> <span id=\"t=3348.756\" data-timecode=\"3348.756\">to search in your device.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3349.626\" data-timecode=\"3349.626\">You just pull down one on your home screen</span> <span id=\"t=3351.886\" data-timecode=\"3351.886\">and you can execute these searches,</span> <span id=\"t=3353.306\" data-timecode=\"3353.306\">find things like launching apps or find an email message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3357.046\" data-timecode=\"3357.046\">But now, with those same things we showed you in Yosemite,</span> <span id=\"t=3360.176\" data-timecode=\"3360.176\">with Spotlight Suggestions, you can get it so much more.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3363.926\" data-timecode=\"3363.926\">You can search for apps and find matches of apps that you don't</span> <span id=\"t=3366.736\" data-timecode=\"3366.736\">yet have on the App Store.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3369.016\" data-timecode=\"3369.016\">You can search for points of interest</span> <span id=\"t=3371.006\" data-timecode=\"3371.006\">and get Wikipedia entries and directions.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3373.806\" data-timecode=\"3373.806\">You can search for news, search for restaurants, songs,</span> <span id=\"t=3379.156\" data-timecode=\"3379.156\">not just in your own library but also on iTunes.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3381.926\" data-timecode=\"3381.926\">And, when you search for a movie, you can get results both</span> <span id=\"t=3385.256\" data-timecode=\"3385.256\">for theaters nearby as well as content available for streaming.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3390.826\" data-timecode=\"3390.826\">And, when you search inside of Safari in addition</span> <span id=\"t=3394.926\" data-timecode=\"3394.926\">to your great Google Search suggestions,</span> <span id=\"t=3397.256\" data-timecode=\"3397.256\">you can also get a suggestion at a glance</span> <span id=\"t=3399.626\" data-timecode=\"3399.626\">for the answer you're looking for right</span> <span id=\"t=3401.696\" data-timecode=\"3401.696\">from Spotlight Suggestions.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3403.706\" data-timecode=\"3403.706\">So, that is the new Spotlight.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3406.146\" data-timecode=\"3406.146\">Next, the keyboard and the technology we call QuickType.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3412.146\" data-timecode=\"3412.146\">Oh.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3413.016\" data-timecode=\"3413.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3414.776\" data-timecode=\"3414.776\">So, prior to iPhone, this was the state-of-the-art</span> <span id=\"t=3419.126\" data-timecode=\"3419.126\">in smartphone typing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3420.666\" data-timecode=\"3420.666\">But, iPhone changed all of that with the introduction of Touch.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3424.156\" data-timecode=\"3424.156\">And, we've been able to do so much more like access</span> <span id=\"t=3427.556\" data-timecode=\"3427.556\">to special characters or alternate character sets,</span> <span id=\"t=3431.396\" data-timecode=\"3431.396\">special keyboard layouts, even handwriting and dictation.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3436.426\" data-timecode=\"3436.426\">But, underlying it all have been the language models</span> <span id=\"t=3440.696\" data-timecode=\"3440.696\">under autocorrect.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3442.956\" data-timecode=\"3442.956\">Well now, in iOS 8, QuickType supports predictive</span> <span id=\"t=3448.166\" data-timecode=\"3448.166\">typing suggestions.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3449.686\" data-timecode=\"3449.686\">So, as you type, you get suggestions</span> <span id=\"t=3452.576\" data-timecode=\"3452.576\">for the next words you might want to type,</span> <span id=\"t=3454.606\" data-timecode=\"3454.606\">and you can tap things out faster than ever before</span> <span id=\"t=3458.166\" data-timecode=\"3458.166\">and it's incredibly smart.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3460.306\" data-timecode=\"3460.306\">So, it's context sensitive.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3462.386\" data-timecode=\"3462.386\">For instance in messages, if someone asks you,</span> <span id=\"t=3464.286\" data-timecode=\"3464.286\">do you want to go for dinner or a movie?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3465.576\" data-timecode=\"3465.576\">It's going to suggest dinner or a movie.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3468.516\" data-timecode=\"3468.516\">[ Applause

id=\"t=3479.596\" data-timecode=\"3479.596\">to different people in different apps.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3481.836\" data-timecode=\"3481.836\">So, maybe you're communicating with a co-worker and it's going</span> <span id=\"t=3484.416\" data-timecode=\"3484.416\">to say, well, the meeting was canceled, rescheduled, moved.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3487.466\" data-timecode=\"3487.466\">These are kind of formal terms.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3489.876\" data-timecode=\"3489.876\">But now, if you're communicating with someone else,</span> <span id=\"t=3491.236\" data-timecode=\"3491.236\">we have a different communication style,</span> <span id=\"t=3493.906\" data-timecode=\"3493.906\">you might get the meeting was epic, awesome or a snoozer</span> <span id=\"t=3497.546\" data-timecode=\"3497.546\">because it learns how you type.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3500.576\" data-timecode=\"3500.576\">And, when it does, it does</span> <span id=\"t=3502.246\" data-timecode=\"3502.246\">so in a way that's always protecting your privacy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3505.696\" data-timecode=\"3505.696\">All that learning is done local to the device and none</span> <span id=\"t=3508.316\" data-timecode=\"3508.316\">of your keystrokes leave the device.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3511.126\" data-timecode=\"3511.126\">Now, QuickType has great language models</span> <span id=\"t=3513.666\" data-timecode=\"3513.666\">for all of these languages.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3515.516\" data-timecode=\"3515.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3521.856\" data-timecode=\"3521.856\">So, I think we're all going to be typing a whole lot faster.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3524.476\" data-timecode=\"3524.476\">Next of course, continuity.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3526.776\" data-timecode=\"3526.776\">You get all the great continuity features.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3528.856\" data-timecode=\"3528.856\">So now, on your iPads, you can pick</span> <span id=\"t=3530.936\" data-timecode=\"3530.936\">up where you left off on your iPhone.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3534.316\" data-timecode=\"3534.316\">You can set up an instant hotspot</span> <span id=\"t=3536.316\" data-timecode=\"3536.316\">with no configuration on your iPad.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3539.266\" data-timecode=\"3539.266\">You can receive your messages on your iPad</span> <span id=\"t=3541.986\" data-timecode=\"3541.986\">and when you receive a call from someone going like this,</span> <span id=\"t=3544.816\" data-timecode=\"3544.816\">you can pick it up right on your iPad.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3548.266\" data-timecode=\"3548.266\">It's really

class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3569.516\" data-timecode=\"3569.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3574.516\" data-timecode=\"3574.516\">And, if you've ever been on one of those noisy threads</span> <span id=\"t=3576.656\" data-timecode=\"3576.656\">that just keeps buzzing in your pocket, well,</span> <span id=\"t=3578.056\" data-timecode=\"3578.056\">you can do not disturb on a per thread level and you can choose</span> <span id=\"t=3581.616\" data-timecode=\"3581.616\">when to leave the tread.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3582.776\" data-timecode=\"3582.776\">This is pretty important.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3584.516\" data-timecode=\"3584.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3589.756\" data-timecode=\"3589.756\">Now, you also can share your location</span> <span id=\"t=3592.376\" data-timecode=\"3592.376\">with people in a conversation.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3594.246\" data-timecode=\"3594.246\">And, if they've shared their location with you,</span> <span id=\"t=3596.346\" data-timecode=\"3596.346\">you can see it from write with inside messages.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3599.226\" data-timecode=\"3599.226\">And you also have really great at a glance view of all</span> <span id=\"t=3602.816\" data-timecode=\"3602.816\">of the pictures and attachments that are shared on any thread.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3606.826\" data-timecode=\"3606.826\">But one feature that I really love is our new Tap to Talk.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3611.806\" data-timecode=\"3611.806\">You just hold your finger down on the microphone button</span> <span id=\"t=3615.516\" data-timecode=\"3615.516\">and then you can just swipe up with your finger</span> <span id=\"t=3617.666\" data-timecode=\"3617.666\">when you're done talking and send what you said.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3620.406\" data-timecode=\"3620.406\">And it's really great for video messaging as well.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3624.286\" data-timecode=\"3624.286\">So to give you a quick demo of the all new messages,</span> <span id=\"t=3627.756\" data-timecode=\"3627.756\">I'd like to bring up Greg Joswiak to the stage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3630.696\" data-timecode=\"3630.696\">Jos?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3631.516\" data-timecode=\"3631.516\">[ Applause &amp; Cheering ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3634.776\" data-timecode=\"3634.776\">Thank you Craig.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3637.206\" data-timecode=\"3637.206\">It's fun to be up here to be the first one</span> <span id=\"t=3638.796\" data-timecode=\"3638.796\">to show you what a rich and powerful platform</span> <span id=\"t=3641.766\" data-timecode=\"3641.766\">for communication messages has become.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3644.026\" data-timecode=\"3644.026\">So let's get right into it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3645.436\" data-timecode=\"3645.436\">So I got a message here waiting from my friend</span> <span id=\"t=3647.386\" data-timecode=\"3647.386\">and co-worker, Kim Vorrath.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3649.096\" data-timecode=\"3649.096\">So I could just slide that of course as usual.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3651.326\" data-timecode=\"3651.326\">It goes right into my messages.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3653.406\" data-timecode=\"3653.406\">And what I see here is I have a thread</span> <span id=\"t=3655.256\" data-timecode=\"3655.256\">between me, Kim, and Craig.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3657.496\" data-timecode=\"3657.496\">But what I have that's new</span> <span id=\"t=3658.826\" data-timecode=\"3658.826\">in the upper right hand corner is this Details button.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3661.656\" data-timecode=\"3661.656\">So if I tap it, it gives me all kinds of information</span> <span id=\"t=3664.396\" data-timecode=\"3664.396\">about participants in the message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3667.276\" data-timecode=\"3667.276\">For one, Craig and Kim decided to share their location with me.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3671.136\" data-timecode=\"3671.136\">So Craig of course is up here with us</span> <span id=\"t=3672.616\" data-timecode=\"3672.616\">in San Francisco while Kim is working hard back in Cupertino.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3676.886\" data-timecode=\"3676.886\">Thanks Kim for that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3678.076\" data-timecode=\"3678.076\">One of the things I can do is add contacts.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3680.776\" data-timecode=\"3680.776\">I can add people to this conversation as we go,</span> <span id=\"t=3682.676\" data-timecode=\"3682.676\">but I can also choose to share my location.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3685.486\" data-timecode=\"3685.486\">So if I just tap and Share My Location, I can choose</span> <span id=\"t=3687.326\" data-timecode=\"3687.326\">to share my location for an hour for the rest of the day</span> <span id=\"t=3690.356\" data-timecode=\"3690.356\">or I can keep sharing it until I stop somewhere in the future.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3693.976\" data-timecode=\"3693.976\">But what's really convenient is this Do Not Disturb button.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3697.226\" data-timecode=\"3697.226\">How many times you've been in one</span> <span id=\"t=3698.856\" data-timecode=\"3698.856\">of those super chatty group conversations</span> <span id=\"t=3701.296\" data-timecode=\"3701.296\">that your phone is just continuing</span> <span id=\"t=3702.796\" data-timecode=\"3702.796\">to buzz over and over?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3704.576\" data-timecode=\"3704.576\">Well now, I can just choose to Do Not Disturb</span> <span id=\"t=3706.816\" data-timecode=\"3706.816\">that particular thread and not get my phone buzzing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3710.126\" data-timecode=\"3710.126\">So, I'm going to find that useful with Kim</span> <span id=\"t=3711.616\" data-timecode=\"3711.616\">and Craig, I know that for sure.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3714.196\" data-timecode=\"3714.196\">Or I can even Leave this Conversation</span> <span id=\"t=3715.896\" data-timecode=\"3715.896\">with just a single tap.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3717.406\" data-timecode=\"3717.406\">What's also convenient is the fact</span> <span id=\"t=3718.886\" data-timecode=\"3718.886\">that I have all the attachments, all the photos</span> <span id=\"t=3721.606\" data-timecode=\"3721.606\">from this conversation all in one place.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3723.706\" data-timecode=\"3723.706\">So they still appear in line in the thread but now instead</span> <span id=\"t=3727.206\" data-timecode=\"3727.206\">of trying to find that picture by scrolling, scrolling,</span> <span id=\"t=3729.506\" data-timecode=\"3729.506\">scrolling, they all come in one place here in the thread,</span> <span id=\"t=3732.356\" data-timecode=\"3732.356\">so very, very convenient.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3733.726\" data-timecode=\"3733.726\">So let's go back to that conversation,</span> <span id=\"t=3735.496\" data-timecode=\"3735.496\">Kim had asked me how it's going.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3737.166\" data-timecode=\"3737.166\">Well, I have lots of ways to reply to her.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3738.916\" data-timecode=\"3738.916\">I could tap out which just a few taps and, you know,</span> <span id=\"t=3741.316\" data-timecode=\"3741.316\">use my predictive keyboard, a message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3743.596\" data-timecode=\"3743.596\">But it's even cooler that I can now do an audio or video message</span> <span id=\"t=3746.716\" data-timecode=\"3746.716\">to her with just a swipe.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3748.516\" data-timecode=\"3748.516\">So I'll send back an audio message to her.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3751.976\" data-timecode=\"3751.976\">Hey Kim, I'm just hanging out here with about 6,000</span> <span id=\"t=3755.776\" data-timecode=\"3755.776\">of our closest friends.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3756.796\" data-timecode=\"3756.796\">Having a good time while Craig takes a much deserved</span> <span id=\"t=3759.046\" data-timecode=\"3759.046\">break backstage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3760.586\" data-timecode=\"3760.586\">Slide up, sends the message just like that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3763.956\" data-timecode=\"3763.956\">Super easy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3765.276\" data-timecode=\"3765.276\">And I can do the same thing with a video message</span> <span id=\"t=3767.266\" data-timecode=\"3767.266\">or even with a selfie.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3768.336\" data-timecode=\"3768.336\">So I'm going to dare a selfie here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3770.046\" data-timecode=\"3770.046\">It's all down the camera button.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3774.516\" data-timecode=\"3774.516\">[ Laughter &amp; Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3782.626\" data-timecode=\"3782.626\">Not my best look.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3783.586\" data-timecode=\"3783.586\">Let's see what Kim has to say about that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3786.486\" data-timecode=\"3786.486\">So, I can see, I got an audio message from Kim,</span> <span id=\"t=3788.866\" data-timecode=\"3788.866\">all I have to do is tap the play button and hear the message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3791.936\" data-timecode=\"3791.936\">Impressive Jos.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3792.896\" data-timecode=\"3792.896\">You've totally mastered the duck face selfie.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3796.466\" data-timecode=\"3796.466\">Well, I'm glad she likes it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3798.476\" data-timecode=\"3798.476\">So it's super duper easy to do this sort of things.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3801.506\" data-timecode=\"3801.506\">You notice that it said it would expire in a couple</span> <span id=\"t=3803.486\" data-timecode=\"3803.486\">of minutes 'cause you don't want to have this clean this up.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3805.376\" data-timecode=\"3805.376\">Audio and video messages can take up space</span> <span id=\"t=3807.126\" data-timecode=\"3807.126\">so it self-destruct unless you choose</span> <span id=\"t=3808.606\" data-timecode=\"3808.606\">to keep whoa, what's this?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3810.616\" data-timecode=\"3810.616\">So Craig should be backstage</span> <span id=\"t=3811.896\" data-timecode=\"3811.896\">but he apparently has sent me a message and it looks important.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3814.106\" data-timecode=\"3814.106\">So if you don't mind I'm going to play it back.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3815.296\" data-timecode=\"3815.296\">And I can play it back in line even with a video message here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3818.286\" data-timecode=\"3818.286\">Jos, we got a serious situation developing back here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3822.616\" data-timecode=\"3822.616\">I can't control this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3823.716\" data-timecode=\"3823.716\">These are not going to work.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3825.576\" data-timecode=\"3825.576\">Bryan, you got to do something.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3827.176\" data-timecode=\"3827.176\">I got it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3831.026\" data-timecode=\"3831.026\">Jos, I'm going to need you to buy some more time.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3833.516\" data-timecode=\"3833.516\">[ Laughter &amp; Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3841.796\" data-timecode=\"3841.796\">Needless to say, hair like that doesn't come easy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3844.546\" data-timecode=\"3844.546\">So while he's dealing with his crisis backstage</span> <span id=\"t=3847.296\" data-timecode=\"3847.296\">oh look, I've actually got an audio message from him.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3849.646\" data-timecode=\"3849.646\">Now, what's really cool is I can actually listen</span> <span id=\"t=3851.856\" data-timecode=\"3851.856\">to audio messages and reply to them from the lock screen simply</span> <span id=\"t=3854.856\" data-timecode=\"3854.856\">by raising the iPhone to my ear.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3856.826\" data-timecode=\"3856.826\">Hey Jos, we got the crisis contained back here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3861.256\" data-timecode=\"3861.256\">I'm good to go, so wrap it up whenever you're ready.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3865.356\" data-timecode=\"3865.356\">And that's easy to listen to a message.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3866.966\" data-timecode=\"3866.966\">I can reply to it the same way.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3870.166\" data-timecode=\"3870.166\">Craig, it's good to hear</span> <span id=\"t=3870.916\" data-timecode=\"3870.916\">that you survived the great hair crisis of 2014.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3873.956\" data-timecode=\"3873.956\">I'll get things wrapped up here</span> <span id=\"t=3874.986\" data-timecode=\"3874.986\">and we'll get the show back to you.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3877.506\" data-timecode=\"3877.506\">Lower it and the message is sent.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3879.206\" data-timecode=\"3879.206\">Super easy.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3880.726\" data-timecode=\"3880.726\">So</span> <span id=\"t=3881.516\" data-timecode=\"3881.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3887.656\" data-timecode=\"3887.656\">So that's the all new Messages app, super easy, super powerful.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3890.946\" data-timecode=\"3890.946\">Send a message through just a swipe or even just</span> <span id=\"t=3893.036\" data-timecode=\"3893.036\">by raising it to your ear.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3894.186\" data-timecode=\"3894.186\">So thank you everybody.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=3895.516\" data-timecode=\"3895.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3902.706\" data-timecode=\"3902.706\">OK. So next up, iCloud Drive.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3909.346\" data-timecode=\"3909.346\">So, of course, iCloud documents work great</span> <span id=\"t=3912.296\" data-timecode=\"3912.296\">across a single app on your iOS devices.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3916.506\" data-timecode=\"3916.506\">But now, with iCloud Drive, you also have a great way</span> <span id=\"t=3920.306\" data-timecode=\"3920.306\">to work across applications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3922.876\" data-timecode=\"3922.876\">So say you're in an app here like Sketchbook, you can bring</span> <span id=\"t=3926.986\" data-timecode=\"3926.986\">up your iCloud Drive panel and open documents directly</span> <span id=\"t=3931.066\" data-timecode=\"3931.066\">from other applications</span> <span id=\"t=3932.366\" data-timecode=\"3932.366\">like a compatible document inside of GoodReader.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3935.226\" data-timecode=\"3935.226\">And when you open it up in that document, in that application</span> <span id=\"t=3938.716\" data-timecode=\"3938.716\">and edit it, those edits are saved right back</span> <span id=\"t=3941.756\" data-timecode=\"3941.756\">to their original locations.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3943.046\" data-timecode=\"3943.046\">So you don't end up with all</span> <span id=\"t=3944.446\" data-timecode=\"3944.446\">of these different versions and copy problems.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3947.086\" data-timecode=\"3947.086\">Now, of course, you also have access to all of those documents</span> <span id=\"t=3950.666\" data-timecode=\"3950.666\">on your Mac and on Windows as well.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3953.796\" data-timecode=\"3953.796\">So that's iCloud Drive.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3955.536\" data-timecode=\"3955.536\">Next up, something you weren't expecting from me, Enterprise.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3959.046\" data-timecode=\"3959.046\">Now it turns out that iOS</span> <span id=\"t=3962.226\" data-timecode=\"3962.226\">yeah, they got one Enterprise guy over there, I know.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3965.386\" data-timecode=\"3965.386\">So iOS is a huge hit in the Enterprise.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3967.916\" data-timecode=\"3967.916\">In fact, 98 percent of the Fortune 500 uses iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3972.626\" data-timecode=\"3972.626\">And we're going to get the last two.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3975.606\" data-timecode=\"3975.606\">And it's in part because of these great</span> <span id=\"t=3979.226\" data-timecode=\"3979.226\">iOS-tailored applications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3982.406\" data-timecode=\"3982.406\">But it's also because of the amazing array of technologies,</span> <span id=\"t=3987.536\" data-timecode=\"3987.536\">both technologies that applied to all of us</span> <span id=\"t=3989.756\" data-timecode=\"3989.756\">in protecting our privacy and security</span> <span id=\"t=3992.366\" data-timecode=\"3992.366\">but also Enterprise manageability features</span> <span id=\"t=3994.736\" data-timecode=\"3994.736\">that we've added to iOS over the years.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=3997.346\" data-timecode=\"3997.346\">Now, one of them that we just released</span> <span id=\"t=3999.976\" data-timecode=\"3999.976\">in the last few months I think is emblematic of our philosophy</span> <span id=\"t=4003.926\" data-timecode=\"4003.926\">of the Enterprise, and that's the Device Enrollment Program.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4007.496\" data-timecode=\"4007.496\">Now traditionally, if you go to work at a company</span> <span id=\"t=4009.796\" data-timecode=\"4009.796\">and they want you to give you a device, they actually have</span> <span id=\"t=4011.896\" data-timecode=\"4011.896\">to take the device they give you, rip it out of its box,</span> <span id=\"t=4015.096\" data-timecode=\"4015.096\">connect it to some PC, image it with software</span> <span id=\"t=4018.216\" data-timecode=\"4018.216\">to configure, it's a big pain.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4020.456\" data-timecode=\"4020.456\">But now with the Device Enrollment Program,</span> <span id=\"t=4022.696\" data-timecode=\"4022.696\">you can actually get your iPad or iPhone</span> <span id=\"t=4025.096\" data-timecode=\"4025.096\">in its original shrink wrap box.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4027.326\" data-timecode=\"4027.326\">And when you open it up, it'll automatically configure itself</span> <span id=\"t=4031.366\" data-timecode=\"4031.366\">for your Enterprise, setting up all of your mail</span> <span id=\"t=4033.776\" data-timecode=\"4033.776\">and getting your mail messages, automatically setting</span> <span id=\"t=4036.136\" data-timecode=\"4036.136\">up your calendar, and even downloading all your Enterprise</span> <span id=\"t=4039.436\" data-timecode=\"4039.436\">apps, it's that simple.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4041.996\" data-timecode=\"4041.996\">Well now, in iOS 8, we continue our focus on security,</span> <span id=\"t=4046.626\" data-timecode=\"4046.626\">productivity and management.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4048.706\" data-timecode=\"4048.706\">iOS 8 has expanded data protection.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4051.106\" data-timecode=\"4051.106\">So you get passcode protection</span> <span id=\"t=4053.096\" data-timecode=\"4053.096\">of all the major data types including third-party apps.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4056.626\" data-timecode=\"4056.626\">We have a Per-message S/MIME</span> <span id=\"t=4058.876\" data-timecode=\"4058.876\">and we have a great productivity feature I think we're all going</span> <span id=\"t=4061.356\" data-timecode=\"4061.356\">to like called VIP threads.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4063.866\" data-timecode=\"4063.866\">So now, there's a thread you're on or message you send,</span> <span id=\"t=4066.796\" data-timecode=\"4066.796\">and you want to get notified</span> <span id=\"t=4067.786\" data-timecode=\"4067.786\">on the lock screen whenever there's a reply on that thread,</span> <span id=\"t=4070.616\" data-timecode=\"4070.616\">you can get that with just a tap.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4073.046\" data-timecode=\"4073.046\">Now we also have Automatic Reply for Exchange, for Out

Enterprise document providers</span> <span id=\"t=4084.226\" data-timecode=\"4084.226\">in addition to iCloud, integrated right</span> <span id=\"t=4086.666\" data-timecode=\"4086.666\">in to iCloud capable applications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4089.516\" data-timecode=\"4089.516\">Now we also improved our management</span> <span id=\"t=4091.246\" data-timecode=\"4091.246\">yes, the Enterprise guy back there.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=4093.241\" data-timecode=\"4093.241\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4095.466\" data-timecode=\"4095.466\">So, we also extend our management</span> <span id=\"t=4098.836\" data-timecode=\"4098.836\">to include managed books and PDFs,</span> <span id=\"t=4100.586\" data-timecode=\"4100.586\">and this is of course especially valuable for education.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4104.916\" data-timecode=\"4104.916\">So those are just a few features for Enterprise.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4107.856\" data-timecode=\"4107.856\">Now, something that we all care a lot about, Health.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4111.626\" data-timecode=\"4111.626\">Whoa.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=4113.515\" data-timecode=\"4113.515\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4116.376\" data-timecode=\"4116.376\">So, developers have created a vast array of healthcare devices</span> <span id=\"t=4122.376\" data-timecode=\"4122.376\">and accompanying applications,</span> <span id=\"t=4124.216\" data-timecode=\"4124.216\">everything from monitoring your activity level,</span> <span id=\"t=4127.246\" data-timecode=\"4127.246\">to your heart rate, to your weight,</span> <span id=\"t=4130.216\" data-timecode=\"4130.216\">and chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure</span> <span id=\"t=4133.236\" data-timecode=\"4133.236\">and diabetes, but up to now the information gathered</span> <span id=\"t=4137.145\" data-timecode=\"4137.145\">by those applications lives in silos.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4140.406\" data-timecode=\"4140.406\">You can't get a single comprehensive picture</span> <span id=\"t=4143.645\" data-timecode=\"4143.645\">of your health situation.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4145.656\" data-timecode=\"4145.656\">But now you can with HealthKit.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4148.886\" data-timecode=\"4148.886\">HealthKit provides a single place</span> <span id=\"t=4151.576\" data-timecode=\"4151.576\">that applications can contribute to a composite profile</span> <span id=\"t=4154.685\" data-timecode=\"4154.685\">of your activity and health.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4157.386\" data-timecode=\"4157.386\">And HealthKit comes</span> <span id=\"t=4158.776\" data-timecode=\"4158.776\">with a corresponding application, Health.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4161.486\" data-timecode=\"4161.486\">And with Health, you can monitor all of your metrics</span> <span id=\"t=4166.496\" data-timecode=\"4166.496\">that you're most interested in your activity.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4169.446\" data-timecode=\"4169.446\">But not just that, you can use third-party applications.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4173.216\" data-timecode=\"4173.216\">Now we carefully protect your privacy</span> <span id=\"t=4175.216\" data-timecode=\"4175.216\">so you have total control over which applications have access</span> <span id=\"t=4178.176\" data-timecode=\"4178.176\">to which part of your healthcare information.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4181.145\" data-timecode=\"4181.145\">But you can for instance provide different activity, weight,</span> <span id=\"t=4184.265\" data-timecode=\"4184.265\">heart rate information to the Nike app.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4187.566\" data-timecode=\"4187.566\">And Nike is working to integrate HealthKit,</span> <span id=\"t=4189.926\" data-timecode=\"4189.926\">so they use that information to help you in your pursuit</span> <span id=\"t=4192.366\" data-timecode=\"4192.366\">of your personalized fitness goals.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4194.976\" data-timecode=\"4194.976\">Now, we're also working with the Mayo Clinic,</span> <span id=\"t=4198.016\" data-timecode=\"4198.016\">innovators in healthcare.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4200.526\" data-timecode=\"4200.526\">And with their integration with HealthKit, they're going</span> <span id=\"t=4203.326\" data-timecode=\"4203.326\">to be able that when a patient takes let's say a blood pressure</span> <span id=\"t=4207.916\" data-timecode=\"4207.916\">reading, HealthKit automatically notifies their app</span> <span id=\"t=4211.316\" data-timecode=\"4211.316\">and their app is automatically able to check whether</span> <span id=\"t=4213.816\" data-timecode=\"4213.816\">that reading is within that patient's personalized</span> <span id=\"t=4216.436\" data-timecode=\"4216.436\">healthcare parameters and thresholds.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4218.706\" data-timecode=\"4218.706\">And if not, it can contact the hospital proactively,</span> <span id=\"t=4222.106\" data-timecode=\"4222.106\">notify a doctor and that doctor can reach back</span> <span id=\"t=4225.006\" data-timecode=\"4225.006\">to that patient providing more timely care.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=4228.896\" data-timecode=\"4228.896\">Now</span> <span id=\"t=4230.516\" data-timecode=\"4230.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4235.806\" data-timecode=\"4235.806\">Now we think this is going to be really important for healthcare</span> <span id=\"t=4239.306\" data-timecode=\"4239.306\">and the CEO of the Mayo Clinic agrees.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4242.066\" data-timecode=\"4242.066\">He says that, \"We believe Apple's HealthKit will</span> <span id=\"t=4244.516\" data-timecode=\"4244.516\">revolutionize the health industry</span> <span id=\"t=4247.026\" data-timecode=\"4247.026\">how the health industry interacts with people.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4249.236\" data-timecode=\"4249.236\">We're proud to be at the forefront</span> <span id=\"t=4250.556\" data-timecode=\"4250.556\">of this innovative technology with the Mayo Clinic app.\"</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4254.346\" data-timecode=\"4254.346\">We agree. Now we're also working with leaders</span> <span id=\"t=4257.546\" data-timecode=\"4257.546\">in healthcare applications like Epic systems.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4260.266\" data-timecode=\"4260.266\">Now they provide the technology that enables hospitals serving</span> <span id=\"t=4265.296\" data-timecode=\"4265.296\">over 100 million Americans.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4267.496\" data-timecode=\"4267.496\">And so now with their integration with HealthKit,</span> <span id=\"t=4270.136\" data-timecode=\"4270.136\">patients these leading institutions will be able</span> <span id=\"t=4273.566\" data-timecode=\"4273.566\">to get closer in sharing their information</span> <span id=\"t=4276.556\" data-timecode=\"4276.556\">with their doctors and that is Health.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=4280.516\" data-timecode=\"4280.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4288.566\" data-timecode=\"4288.566\">Next up, Family Sharing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4291.716\" data-timecode=\"4291.716\">It's the easy way to share what's important.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4295.806\" data-timecode=\"4295.806\">Now when I was a kid,</span> <span id=\"t=4298.106\" data-timecode=\"4298.106\">the refrigerator was the center of family sharing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4301.056\" data-timecode=\"4301.056\">Our refrigerator looked just</span> <span id=\"t=4302.316\" data-timecode=\"4302.316\">like this except the kid who had gray hair.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4304.866\" data-timecode=\"4304.866\">But we've now in iOS made it that easy to set up your family</span> <span id=\"t=4311.176\" data-timecode=\"4311.176\">on their iOS devices and once you've set up your family</span> <span id=\"t=4314.436\" data-timecode=\"4314.436\">as a family unit, you automatically get</span> <span id=\"t=4317.506\" data-timecode=\"4317.506\">to share photos with the shared photo stream, to share calendars</span> <span id=\"t=4321.846\" data-timecode=\"4321.846\">with your family, to share reminder list</span> <span id=\"t=4325.036\" data-timecode=\"4325.036\">and automatically configure things</span> <span id=\"t=4326.656\" data-timecode=\"4326.656\">like with permission, Find My Friends.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4329.676\" data-timecode=\"4329.676\">And find your kid's devices, which is something I do</span> <span id=\"t=4332.436\" data-timecode=\"4332.436\">about every other day.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4334.076\" data-timecode=\"4334.076\">It's really handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4336.026\" data-timecode=\"4336.026\">Now, of course, we're also used</span> <span id=\"t=4338.286\" data-timecode=\"4338.286\">to in the home sharing physical media.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4340.576\" data-timecode=\"4340.576\">But increasingly, our media is in the form of songs</span> <span id=\"t=4344.266\" data-timecode=\"4344.266\">from iTunes, movies, books, and apps.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4350.076\" data-timecode=\"4350.076\">Well now, with Family Sharing,</span> <span id=\"t=4352.436\" data-timecode=\"4352.436\">you can get it not just your purchases but the purchase</span> <span id=\"t=4355.196\" data-timecode=\"4355.196\">of all the members of your family.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=4358.516\"

data-timecode=\"4369.656\">And this is for up to six family members</span> <span id=\"t=4372.316\" data-timecode=\"4372.316\">who all share the same credit card.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4375.646\" data-timecode=\"4375.646\">And it works great for kids as well and not just</span> <span id=\"t=4379.356\" data-timecode=\"4379.356\">because they can make purchases on your credit card,</span> <span id=\"t=4381.406\" data-timecode=\"4381.406\">but in fact because when they do make a purchase,</span> <span id=\"t=4384.696\" data-timecode=\"4384.696\">they get prompted ask you

data-timecode=\"4400.036\">Next, Photos.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4402.476\" data-timecode=\"4402.476\">We all take a lot of photos increasingly with our iPhones</span> <span id=\"t=4408.716\" data-timecode=\"4408.716\">and we share them with whatever device we have handy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4413.096\" data-timecode=\"4413.096\">Well now, we're bringing together photos with iCloud</span> <span id=\"t=4419.186\" data-timecode=\"4419.186\">so that every photo you take are available to you</span> <span id=\"t=4422.336\" data-timecode=\"4422.336\">on all of your

preserving the common organization edits you do</span> <span id=\"t=4433.866\" data-timecode=\"4433.866\">to all of your photos for your consistent iCloud photo library</span> <span id=\"t=4438.626\" data-timecode=\"4438.626\">but your device actually has access to more photos</span> <span id=\"t=4442.106\" data-timecode=\"4442.106\">in the cloud than it can physically store locally</span> <span id=\"t=4445.216\" data-timecode=\"4445.216\">so you can get them all wherever you are.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4448.976\" data-timecode=\"4448.976\">Now of course, if you have these many photos,</span> <span id=\"t=4452.616\" data-timecode=\"4452.616\">you want great search and so we now on iOS 8 Photos,</span> <span id=\"t=4457.806\" data-timecode=\"4457.806\">we give you great search suggestions for instance</span> <span id=\"t=4460.636\" data-timecode=\"4460.636\">of locations, photos taken near where you are right now,</span> <span id=\"t=4465.076\" data-timecode=\"4465.076\">photos taken a year ago today, photos taken in your home,</span> <span id=\"t=4468.726\" data-timecode=\"4468.726\">but we also give you search.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4471.296\" data-timecode=\"4471.296\">And so that search lets you match on things like location,</span> <span id=\"t=4475.206\" data-timecode=\"4475.206\">time, and also on albums that you've set up.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4481.706\" data-timecode=\"4481.706\">Now, we also help you perfect your photos</span> <span id=\"t=4484.216\" data-timecode=\"4484.216\">with great new Smart

also for things like auto-straightening and cropping.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4495.186\" data-timecode=\"4495.186\">I'd like to give you a demo of our new Photos app now.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=4500.516\" data-timecode=\"4500.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4505.896\" data-timecode=\"4505.896\">All right.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4506.866\" data-timecode=\"4506.866\">Let's take a look at photos.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4510.956\" data-timecode=\"4510.956\">So here I am in my large cloud photo collection,</span> <span id=\"t=4514.746\" data-timecode=\"4514.746\">and I have great search here, so I have all my suggestion</span> <span id=\"t=4518.436\" data-timecode=\"4518.436\">but I can also start typing and you notice I get matches</span> <span id=\"t=4521.586\" data-timecode=\"4521.586\">on location and time period.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4523.856\" data-timecode=\"4523.856\">But also an album, so here I have beach day with Mandy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4526.476\" data-timecode=\"4526.476\">And I can tap right in there,</span> <span id=\"t=4528.636\" data-timecode=\"4528.636\">look through these nice photos, let's take a look.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4532.066\" data-timecode=\"4532.066\">Those are some good ones.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4533.946\" data-timecode=\"4533.946\">Now that's a photo that I think has potential</span> <span id=\"t=4537.796\" data-timecode=\"4537.796\">but it's really quite dark and kind of washed out.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4540.686\" data-timecode=\"4540.686\">Unfortunately, we have these great smart editing controls</span> <span id=\"t=4542.906\" data-timecode=\"4542.906\">that I can use to fix it up, so I'm going to bring up our levels</span> <span id=\"t=4545.716\" data-timecode=\"4545.716\">and you also have levels for light and color</span> <span id=\"t=4547.916\" data-timecode=\"4547.916\">down there at the bottom.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4548.746\" data-timecode=\"4548.746\">I'm going tap on light,</span> <span id=\"t=4549.546\" data-timecode=\"4549.546\">and I get this great smart light meter.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4553.176\" data-timecode=\"4553.176\">Now I can just drag this across like this and it lightens</span> <span id=\"t=4556.486\" data-timecode=\"4556.486\">up the photo really nicely,</span> <span id=\"t=4558.776\" data-timecode=\"4558.776\">so I dial that in just the way I want.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4560.986\" data-timecode=\"4560.986\">But what's happening under the hood is really amazing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4564.086\" data-timecode=\"4564.086\">You notice that to achieve the lightning effect,</span> <span id=\"t=4566.896\" data-timecode=\"4566.896\">it brought brightness and contrast up, exposure</span> <span id=\"t=4570.176\" data-timecode=\"4570.176\">and highlights down and shadows up based</span> <span id=\"t=4572.806\" data-timecode=\"4572.806\">on detailed image analysis of what would achieve that effect.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4576.036\" data-timecode=\"4576.036\">Now I could go in and I could manually try</span> <span id=\"t=4578.266\" data-timecode=\"4578.266\">to tweak those parameters like have that level of control</span> <span id=\"t=4581.266\" data-timecode=\"4581.266\">but I don't need to because it does such a great job</span> <span id=\"t=4583.846\" data-timecode=\"4583.846\">and I also have that control for color, so I can just drive</span> <span id=\"t=4587.836\" data-timecode=\"4587.836\">up the color for instance, bring out the sky and the skin tones</span> <span id=\"t=4591.936\" data-timecode=\"4591.936\">and I

data-timecode=\"4727.116\">Now here's a photo that looks really</span> <span id=\"t=4729.296\" data-timecode=\"4729.296\">like it's got some potential</span> <span id=\"t=4730.396\" data-timecode=\"4730.396\">but it could use some brightening up,</span> <span id=\"t=4733.086\" data-timecode=\"4733.086\">can have the same kinds of adjustments.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4735.726\" data-timecode=\"4735.726\">You notice here at this light and color meters, well,</span> <span id=\"t=4737.946\" data-timecode=\"4737.946\">I can just close this control, so we can

notice how some of these are going up and some are going</span> <span id=\"t=4746.686\" data-timecode=\"4746.686\">down to create this effect, it's really great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4750.836\" data-timecode=\"4750.836\">I can do the same with color, let's just boost the color,</span> <span id=\"t=4755.586\" data-timecode=\"4755.586\">bring out the sky, bring out the skin tones, and it's that easy,</span> <span id=\"t=4761.126\" data-timecode=\"4761.126\">the new photos app, to really create beautiful images.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4765.156\"

coming to iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4835.016\" data-timecode=\"4835.016\">But of course, there's always a whole lot more</span> <span id=\"t=4838.426\" data-timecode=\"4838.426\">than I have time to talk about here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4840.566\" data-timecode=\"4840.566\">I do want to hit on just two more quickly, and one is Siri.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4844.886\" data-timecode=\"4844.886\">Now, we have if you take your phone and you plug it</span> <span id=\"t=4848.736\" data-timecode=\"4848.736\">in for instance in the car, you can say, \"Hey Siri,\"</span> <span id=\"t=4851.656\" data-timecode=\"4851.656\">and start talking to Siri without having</span> <span id=\"t=4853.946\" data-timecode=\"4853.946\">to even touch your phone.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4855.906\" data-timecode=\"4855.906\">And we have song recognition with Shazam.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4858.606\" data-timecode=\"4858.606\">So now, if you just start up Siri and there's a song playing</span> <span id=\"t=4861.426\" data-timecode=\"4861.426\">around you, it will tell you what it is</span> <span id=\"t=4863.476\" data-timecode=\"4863.476\">and you can even purchase it right there from within Siri.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4867.406\" data-timecode=\"4867.406\">Siri also now supports streaming voice recognition.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4870.416\" data-timecode=\"4870.416\">So as you talk, you can see what it's recognizing.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4872.536\" data-timecode=\"4872.536\">It's more responsive than ever, and we have support</span> <span id=\"t=4875.596\" data-timecode=\"4875.596\">for 22 new dictation languages.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4879.656\" data-timecode=\"4879.656\">Finally, in China we now have greatly improved maps</span> <span id=\"t=4883.686\" data-timecode=\"4883.686\">with vector based maps and turn by turn directions.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4887.776\"

</p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4933.496\" data-timecode=\"4933.496\">The second part of the story is what iOS 8 provides</span> <span id=\"t=4938.386\" data-timecode=\"4938.386\">for developers.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4940.196\" data-timecode=\"4940.196\">And extending your capability to make even more incredible apps</span> <span id=\"t=4944.716\" data-timecode=\"4944.716\">and apps you could

data-timecode=\"4954.356\">The App Store now has over 1.2 million of your apps on it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4960.276\" data-timecode=\"4960.276\">This is a phenomenal number.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4962.636\" data-timecode=\"4962.636\">And the marketplace around these apps is unbelievably vibrant,</span> <span id=\"t=4968.146\" data-timecode=\"4968.146\">300,000,000 people visit the App Store every week.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4974.566\" data-timecode=\"4974.566\">And these people aren't just browsing, they are downloading.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=4979.996\"

information or mess with other apps</span> <span id=\"t=5241.136\" data-timecode=\"5241.136\">without your permission.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5242.806\" data-timecode=\"5242.806\">Well, the handle Extensibility in an iOS way,</span> <span id=\"t=5246.616\" data-timecode=\"5246.616\">we wanted to build on the same sandboxing model.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5249.576\" data-timecode=\"5249.576\">So now extensions live inside an application's own sandbox</span> <span id=\"t=5253.426\" data-timecode=\"5253.426\">with access to its own data, but other applications can reach</span> <span id=\"t=5256.846\" data-timecode=\"5256.846\">out by way of iOS' security mechanisms,</span> <span id=\"t=5260.816\" data-timecode=\"5260.816\">talk to that extension.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5261.946\" data-timecode=\"5261.946\">That extension can even project UI right back</span> <span id=\"t=5264.746\" data-timecode=\"5264.746\">in to the originating app.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5266.556\" data-timecode=\"5266.556\">Now this enables some great things.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5268.796\" data-timecode=\"5268.796\">For instance, in addition</span> <span id=\"t=5270.136\" data-timecode=\"5270.136\">to the systems built-in sharing options,</span> <span id=\"t=5272.606\" data-timecode=\"5272.606\">an app like Pinterest can offer share sheet to Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5277.226\" data-timecode=\"5277.226\">And if you look at actions, for instance,</span> <span id=\"t=5280.496\" data-timecode=\"5280.496\">an app like Bing could offer translation right inside</span> <span id=\"t=5284.356\" data-timecode=\"5284.356\">of Safari accessing the web pages web content right there.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5290.276\" data-timecode=\"5290.276\">Now we're also supporting photo filters inside the photos,</span> <span id=\"t=5294.616\" data-timecode=\"5294.616\">and enabling third parties</span> <span id=\"t=5296.316\" data-timecode=\"5296.316\">to define their own document providers that work</span> <span id=\"t=5299.206\" data-timecode=\"5299.206\">within the iCloud drive-enabled application.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5303.166\" data-timecode=\"5303.166\">Finally, we're enabling third party apps to define widgets</span> <span id=\"t=5308.276\" data-timecode=\"5308.276\">that can now go in Notification Center.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5311.516\" data-timecode=\"5311.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5317.206\" data-timecode=\"5317.206\">I think it feels like time for a demo.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5322.336\" data-timecode=\"5322.336\">So let's start with photo filters.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5325.836\" data-timecode=\"5325.836\">So, we're back here in photos</span> <span id=\"t=5327.396\" data-timecode=\"5327.396\">and I've got a nice photo here of a flower.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5331.006\" data-timecode=\"5331.006\">And I'm going to go ahead and edit and you notice an addition</span> <span id=\"t=5333.876\" data-timecode=\"5333.876\">to the options here at the bottom of the screen,</span> <span id=\"t=5336.296\" data-timecode=\"5336.296\">we have at the top left this extensions button.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5339.076\" data-timecode=\"5339.076\">I'm going to click that, tap that rather.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5341.546\" data-timecode=\"5341.546\">And you notice I have several extensions available,</span> <span id=\"t=5344.246\" data-timecode=\"5344.246\">one from VSCO Cam and one from Waterlogue.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5346.756\" data-timecode=\"5346.756\">I'm going to select Waterlogue.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5348.516\" data-timecode=\"5348.516\">And now the Waterlogue extension is able to run right here</span> <span id=\"t=5351.566\" data-timecode=\"5351.566\">in the context of photos to manipulate my photo bringing</span> <span id=\"t=5355.166\" data-timecode=\"5355.166\">up their own UI, deliver this beautiful water color effect</span> <span id=\"t=5361.286\" data-timecode=\"5361.286\">to my photo, and when I'm done, it's right back inside</span> <span id=\"t=5366.166\" data-timecode=\"5366.166\">of my photo album, it's that easy.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5368.516\" data-timecode=\"5368.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5374.356\" data-timecode=\"5374.356\">Then next let's take a look at widgets.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5376.026\" data-timecode=\"5376.026\">So I'm going to just pull down Notification Center.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5379.056\" data-timecode=\"5379.056\">I have my existing widgets here in my Today view.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5382.566\" data-timecode=\"5382.566\">Did you notice an addition to my widget is down here</span> <span id=\"t=5385.126\" data-timecode=\"5385.126\">at the bottom it says \"One New Widget Available\"</span> <span id=\"t=5387.166\" data-timecode=\"5387.166\">because I've downloaded an app recently</span> <span id=\"t=5388.956\" data-timecode=\"5388.956\">that contains a Notification Center widget.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5391.696\" data-timecode=\"5391.696\">So I'm going to tap Edit.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5392.586\" data-timecode=\"5392.586\">And you notice its SportsCenter.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5394.686\" data-timecode=\"5394.686\">So I can tap the plus next to SportsCenter,</span> <span id=\"t=5397.186\" data-timecode=\"5397.186\">position it where I want, I'm on my widgets in my Today view.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5400.926\" data-timecode=\"5400.926\">Tap Done, and now I have information</span> <span id=\"t=5403.116\" data-timecode=\"5403.116\">on my favorite sports teams right here inside</span> <span id=\"t=5406.556\" data-timecode=\"5406.556\">of Notification Center.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5408.306\" data-timecode=\"5408.306\">Now this works great on iPad as well.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5411.166\" data-timecode=\"5411.166\">Let's take a look at iPad.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5413.996\" data-timecode=\"5413.996\">So iPad, I'm going to bring down Notification Center.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5417.156\" data-timecode=\"5417.156\">And you notice I have this interactive widget from eBay.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5420.646\" data-timecode=\"5420.646\">So, I'm bidding on a guitar and apparently I'm being outbid.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5426.066\" data-timecode=\"5426.066\">So I can now write inside of notification, take advantage</span> <span id=\"t=5428.376\" data-timecode=\"5428.376\">of the interactivity widgets.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5430.096\" data-timecode=\"5430.096\">I can tap and bid and just like this,</span> <span id=\"t=5434.066\" data-timecode=\"5434.066\">I can submit a leading bid all inside of Notification Center.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5439.216\" data-timecode=\"5439.216\">Now to wrap it up, I want to show you extensions in Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5441.946\" data-timecode=\"5441.946\">I'm going to bring up Safari.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5444.036\" data-timecode=\"5444.036\">Use our great new tab view.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5445.496\" data-timecode=\"5445.496\">It's a page I've been looking at here with some information</span> <span id=\"t=5449.106\" data-timecode=\"5449.106\">on a beautiful guitar and I'd like to learn more about it but,</span> <span id=\"t=5452.506\" data-timecode=\"5452.506\">unfortunately, you notice the text here is in Japanese</span> <span id=\"t=5455.966\" data-timecode=\"5455.966\">and I do not read Japanese.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5458.196\" data-timecode=\"5458.196\">Fortunately, I have a Bing translation extension,</span> <span id=\"t=5461.126\" data-timecode=\"5461.126\">so I can just bring up my action sheet.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5465.366\" data-timecode=\"5465.366\">And you notice down here in the second row, Bing translate,</span> <span id=\"t=5467.836\" data-timecode=\"5467.836\">I'm going to tap on that and Bing is able</span> <span id=\"t=5470.546\" data-timecode=\"5470.546\">to translate this web page right in line.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5474.286\" data-timecode=\"5474.286\">Look at that.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5475.516\" data-timecode=\"5475.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5482.586\" data-timecode=\"5482.586\">Now for our extension's grand finale,</span> <span id=\"t=5484.426\" data-timecode=\"5484.426\">let's put that on my Pinterest board.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5487.406\" data-timecode=\"5487.406\">You see Pinterest has an extension right here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5489.296\" data-timecode=\"5489.296\">I'm going to tap on that and this is actually able to bring</span> <span id=\"t=5492.726\" data-timecode=\"5492.726\">up a UI defined by Pinterest where I can select my board,</span> <span id=\"t=5495.776\" data-timecode=\"5495.776\">maybe select my guitar's board.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5497.146\" data-timecode=\"5497.146\">Now the Pinterest extension is accessed</span> <span id=\"t=5499.366\" data-timecode=\"5499.366\">to the underlying web page, so I can</span> <span id=\"t=5501.916\" data-timecode=\"5501.916\">let me slide through the different photos</span> <span id=\"t=5503.756\" data-timecode=\"5503.756\">on the page till I find the one I want to share.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5506.486\" data-timecode=\"5506.486\">That's it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5507.446\" data-timecode=\"5507.446\">Tap and I pinned it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5509.646\" data-timecode=\"5509.646\">And that's a quick look at extensions in iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5513.516\" data-timecode=\"5513.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5520.446\" data-timecode=\"5520.446\">Now there's one important kind of extension that I did fail</span> <span id=\"t=5523.806\" data-timecode=\"5523.806\">to mention and that's the ability</span> <span id=\"t=5525.986\" data-timecode=\"5525.986\">to install system-wide third party keyboards.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5530.516\" data-timecode=\"5530.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5536.426\" data-timecode=\"5536.426\">So now if you have special keyboard you want to use,</span> <span id=\"t=5538.656\" data-timecode=\"5538.656\">you can install those in iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5540.396\" data-timecode=\"5540.396\">And by default, those of course run inside</span> <span id=\"t=5543.306\" data-timecode=\"5543.306\">of the most restrictive sandbox with no network access</span> <span id=\"t=5546.606\" data-timecode=\"5546.606\">because we want to make sure to protect your privacy.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5549.176\" data-timecode=\"5549.176\">But if that keyboard requires or you want to grant it ability,</span> <span id=\"t=5553.086\" data-timecode=\"5553.086\">it can ask for access to the network</span> <span id=\"t=5555.736\" data-timecode=\"5555.736\">to provide extended functionality.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5558.126\" data-timecode=\"5558.126\">We put those controls in your hands.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5560.736\" data-timecode=\"5560.736\">That's extensions on iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5564.516\" data-timecode=\"5564.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5571.386\" data-timecode=\"5571.386\">Next up, Touch ID.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5575.516\" data-timecode=\"5575.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5578.046\" data-timecode=\"5578.046\">From the moment we introduced Touch ID,</span> <span id=\"t=5582.826\" data-timecode=\"5582.826\">developers were excited about the potential</span> <span id=\"t=5585.666\" data-timecode=\"5585.666\">and there's no question why,</span> <span id=\"t=5587.406\" data-timecode=\"5587.406\">Touch ID has been extremely popular</span> <span id=\"t=5590.896\" data-timecode=\"5590.896\">and people authenticating in their devices.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5592.726\" data-timecode=\"5592.726\">If you look at passcode usage</span> <span id=\"t=5594.696\" data-timecode=\"5594.696\">on iOS before Touch ID was less than half.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5597.786\" data-timecode=\"5597.786\">On iPhone 5s 83 percent, people love using Touch ID.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5603.166\" data-timecode=\"5603.166\">And now, third party apps can take advantage</span> <span id=\"t=5606.076\" data-timecode=\"5606.076\">of Touch ID as well.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5608.516\" data-timecode=\"5608.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5616.376\" data-timecode=\"5616.376\">So Touch ID protects logins and user data and it works</span> <span id=\"t=5619.176\" data-timecode=\"5619.176\">by unlocking Keychain items.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5621.616\" data-timecode=\"5621.616\">So it identifies successful fingerprint matches</span> <span id=\"t=5624.626\" data-timecode=\"5624.626\">but it always keeps the fingerprint data itself</span> <span id=\"t=5627.706\" data-timecode=\"5627.706\">completely protected inside</span> <span id=\"t=5629.506\" data-timecode=\"5629.506\">of the Secure Enclave in the A7 processor.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5633.006\" data-timecode=\"5633.006\">The fingerprint information is never exposed</span> <span id=\"t=5635.116\" data-timecode=\"5635.116\">to third party apps or the rest of the system for that matter.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5638.006\" data-timecode=\"5638.006\">It's very secure.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5640.166\" data-timecode=\"5640.166\">That's Touch ID.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5641.296\" data-timecode=\"5641.296\">Then next, Cameras.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5643.516\" data-timecode=\"5643.516\">We're providing Camera APIs from manual control of exposure,</span> <span id=\"t=5648.676\" data-timecode=\"5648.676\">white balance and focus.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5650.986\" data-timecode=\"5650.986\">And we've enhanced the PhotoKit API with faster performance,</span> <span id=\"t=5655.326\" data-timecode=\"5655.326\">the ability not just to read but also to write</span> <span id=\"t=5657.436\" data-timecode=\"5657.436\">to the photo library and this is now your cloud photo library</span> <span id=\"t=5660.386\" data-timecode=\"5660.386\">and perform non-destructive edits.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5662.306\" data-timecode=\"5662.306\">It's really great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5664.876\" data-timecode=\"5664.876\">Now, we talked about the great HealthKit API,</span> <span id=\"t=5667.116\" data-timecode=\"5667.116\">but now we'd also have HomeKit.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5671.516\" data-timecode=\"5671.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5678.926\" data-timecode=\"5678.926\">Now, there are a lot of great home automation devices coming</span> <span id=\"t=5682.286\" data-timecode=\"5682.286\">on the market these days and they have companion apps,</span> <span id=\"t=5684.526\" data-timecode=\"5684.526\">things like lights and door locks, webcams,</span> <span id=\"t=5688.876\" data-timecode=\"5688.876\">garage doors, and thermostats.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5692.346\" data-timecode=\"5692.346\">But, you know, each of them have their own application</span> <span id=\"t=5695.026\" data-timecode=\"5695.026\">and they end up defining their own network protocol,</span> <span id=\"t=5698.966\" data-timecode=\"5698.966\">their own security mechanisms.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5701.486\" data-timecode=\"5701.486\">Well, we thought we could bring some rationality to the space.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5705.106\" data-timecode=\"5705.106\">We started working with the leaders</span> <span id=\"t=5707.806\" data-timecode=\"5707.806\">in home automation devices.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5710.276\" data-timecode=\"5710.276\">And we've come up with HomeKit with a common network protocol</span> <span id=\"t=5715.126\" data-timecode=\"5715.126\">that has secure pairing to ensure</span> <span id=\"t=5717.416\" data-timecode=\"5717.416\">that only your iPhone can open your garage door</span> <span id=\"t=5720.746\" data-timecode=\"5720.746\">or unlock your door.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5722.606\" data-timecode=\"5722.606\">And in addition to being able to control individual devices</span> <span id=\"t=5725.746\" data-timecode=\"5725.746\">in your home, with HomeKit you can group devices and changes</span> <span id=\"t=5729.496\" data-timecode=\"5729.496\">in the scenes and then with Siri integration you can say</span> <span id=\"t=5733.126\" data-timecode=\"5733.126\">something like, \"Get ready for bed,\" and be assured</span> <span id=\"t=5735.686\" data-timecode=\"5735.686\">that your garage door is closed, your door is locked,</span> <span id=\"t=5738.356\" data-timecode=\"5738.356\">the thermostat is lower,</span> <span id=\"t=5739.646\" data-timecode=\"5739.646\">and your lights are dimmed, that's HomeKit.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5743.516\" data-timecode=\"5743.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5751.556\" data-timecode=\"5751.556\">Next, CloudKit.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5753.876\" data-timecode=\"5753.876\">So today, if you're a developer</span> <span id=\"t=5755.776\" data-timecode=\"5755.776\">and you're writing an application</span> <span id=\"t=5757.486\" data-timecode=\"5757.486\">and it needs a web component, well, you end up really having</span> <span id=\"t=5760.646\" data-timecode=\"5760.646\">to write two apps in one.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5762.656\" data-timecode=\"5762.656\">In addition to the writing in the client side using Xcode</span> <span id=\"t=5765.506\" data-timecode=\"5765.506\">and our frameworks, you have</span> <span id=\"t=5766.866\" data-timecode=\"5766.866\">to write the server side of the app.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5768.096\" data-timecode=\"5768.096\">You have to write server side app logic, you have to deal</span> <span id=\"t=5771.806\" data-timecode=\"5771.806\">with authentication, asset storage, database storage,</span> <span id=\"t=5774.646\" data-timecode=\"5774.646\">search, even push notifications and then you got</span> <span id=\"t=5777.016\" data-timecode=\"5777.016\">to pay somebody to host it all.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5779.276\" data-timecode=\"5779.276\">Well, now, with CloudKit, CloudKit takes</span> <span id=\"t=5783.086\" data-timecode=\"5783.086\">over the cloud part and provide you</span> <span id=\"t=5785.756\" data-timecode=\"5785.756\">with a client side programming model</span> <span id=\"t=5788.356\" data-timecode=\"5788.356\">that lets you access iCloud

paying,</span> <span id=\"t=5796.836\" data-timecode=\"5796.836\">CloudKit is effectively free, with limits.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5805.716\" data-timecode=\"5805.716\">So, CloudKit scales the data allocated to your app</span> <span id=\"t=5809.606\" data-timecode=\"5809.606\">and bandwidth based on the number of users using your app.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5813.256\" data-timecode=\"5813.256\">And this goes all the way up to granting you free a petabyte</span> <span id=\"t=5816.916\" data-timecode=\"5816.916\">of assets, 10 terabytes of database</span> <span id=\"t=5819.386\" data-timecode=\"5819.386\">and all the bandwidth you can constructively use.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5822.966\" data-timecode=\"5822.966\">That is CloudKit.</span> </p>\n<p

something huge in the area</span> <span id=\"t=5836.706\" data-timecode=\"5836.706\">of 3D graphics, and it's called Metal, so</span> <span id=\"t=5843.016\" data-timecode=\"5843.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5844.886\" data-timecode=\"5844.886\">As you know, OpenGL is the standards based way</span> <span id=\"t=5849.366\" data-timecode=\"5849.366\">for high performance 3D graphics on iOS, giving you access</span> <span id=\"t=5853.486\" data-timecode=\"5853.486\">to the power of the A7 processor.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5857.026\" data-timecode=\"5857.026\">But increasingly, if you look at what goes on in the performance</span> <span id=\"t=5859.486\" data-timecode=\"5859.486\">of the game, in addition to what the game wants to accomplish,</span> <span id=\"t=5862.436\" data-timecode=\"5862.436\">OpenGL ends up being a thick layer of overhead</span> <span id=\"t=5866.466\" data-timecode=\"5866.466\">between the game and the hardware.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5869.756\" data-timecode=\"5869.756\">Well, now, we have Metal.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5871.396\" data-timecode=\"5871.396\">And Metal dramatically reduces</span> <span id=\"t=5873.976\" data-timecode=\"5873.976\">that overhead giving the game near bare</span> <span id=\"t=5876.636\" data-timecode=\"5876.636\">to the metal access to the power of A7.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5879.956\" data-timecode=\"5879.956\">The results are stunning up to 10x faster draw call rates.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5885.736\" data-timecode=\"5885.736\">Now, in addition to these dramatically reduced overheads,</span> <span id=\"t=5891.496\" data-timecode=\"5891.496\">you get access not just to graphics</span> <span id=\"t=5893.236\" data-timecode=\"5893.236\">but to the compute power of the GPU,</span> <span id=\"t=5896.216\" data-timecode=\"5896.216\">and Metal supports pre-compiled shaders</span> <span id=\"t=5898.536\" data-timecode=\"5898.536\">and efficient multithreading</span> <span id=\"t=5899.946\" data-timecode=\"5899.946\">so you can always get the most out of the processor.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5903.106\" data-timecode=\"5903.106\">Now, we've been working with the leading providers</span> <span id=\"t=5906.526\" data-timecode=\"5906.526\">of gaming engines on mobile platforms</span> <span id=\"t=5910.636\" data-timecode=\"5910.636\">and what they've been able to accomplish with Metal</span> <span id=\"t=5913.156\" data-timecode=\"5913.156\">in just a few weeks is truly stunning.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5917.176\" data-timecode=\"5917.176\">Let's start with EA and the work they've done taking their</span> <span id=\"t=5919.946\" data-timecode=\"5919.946\">console level title Plants vs. Zombies and bringing it to iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5927.496\" data-timecode=\"5927.496\">They're able to put over 1.3 million triangles on the screen</span> <span id=\"t=5932.206\" data-timecode=\"5932.206\">at a time and do depth of motion, effects,</span> <span id=\"t=5935.466\" data-timecode=\"5935.466\">depth of field effects that they could never imagine achieving.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5938.686\" data-timecode=\"5938.686\">In fact, they're using their Frostbyte console engine</span> <span id=\"t=5942.186\" data-timecode=\"5942.186\">that they thought could never come to mobile and now it can.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5945.966\" data-timecode=\"5945.966\">And let's look at Crytek.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5948.536\" data-timecode=\"5948.536\">Crytek was able to bring their console-level geom cache to iOS</span> <span id=\"t=5953.736\" data-timecode=\"5953.736\">and they were able to get</span> <span id=\"t=5954.816\" data-timecode=\"5954.816\">up to 4000 draw calls per frame going here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5958.556\" data-timecode=\"5958.556\">This is up to 10x, the kind</span> <span id=\"t=5960.476\" data-timecode=\"5960.476\">of performance they were seeing previously.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5963.726\" data-timecode=\"5963.726\">Now, to show you live what can be done with Metal,</span> <span id=\"t=5969.296\" data-timecode=\"5969.296\">I'd like to bring up the founder of Epic Games</span> <span id=\"t=5972.356\" data-timecode=\"5972.356\">to the stage, Tim Sweeney.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5974.726\" data-timecode=\"5974.726\">Tim, come on up.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=5977.516\" data-timecode=\"5977.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5984.696\" data-timecode=\"5984.696\">Thank you.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5986.246\" data-timecode=\"5986.246\">We've had the opportunity to work with Metal</span> <span id=\"t=5988.446\" data-timecode=\"5988.446\">and to illustrate some of the possibilities,</span> <span id=\"t=5990.286\" data-timecode=\"5990.286\">we created a Zen Garden.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5992.606\" data-timecode=\"5992.606\">Now this environment was built</span> <span id=\"t=5996.306\" data-timecode=\"5996.306\">in Unreal Engine 4 on a high-end Mac.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=5998.636\" data-timecode=\"5998.636\">And now thanks to Metal, we're running it on iPad in Realtime</span> <span id=\"t=6002.516\" data-timecode=\"6002.516\">with full fidelity and performance.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6005.466\" data-timecode=\"6005.466\">Metal's efficiency enable us an order of magnitude increase</span> <span id=\"t=6008.506\" data-timecode=\"6008.506\">in detail making it possible for developers like us</span> <span id=\"t=6011.456\" data-timecode=\"6011.456\">to create a new generation of vivid</span> <span id=\"t=6013.596\" data-timecode=\"6013.596\">and interactive 3D experiences.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6016.146\" data-timecode=\"6016.146\">Now Josh Adams is the programmer who wrote much</span> <span id=\"t=6018.126\" data-timecode=\"6018.126\">of the code that's running.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6019.496\" data-timecode=\"6019.496\">Josh, can you explain what we're seeing here?</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6021.466\" data-timecode=\"6021.466\">Yeah, sure.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6022.486\" data-timecode=\"6022.486\">First of all thanks to Metal support for precompiled shaders,</span> <span id=\"t=6025.576\" data-timecode=\"6025.576\">we can have a huge variety of materials</span> <span id=\"t=6027.126\" data-timecode=\"6027.126\">without a load time impact.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6028.036\" data-timecode=\"6028.036\">And our first stop we'll check out this cherry tree</span> <span id=\"t=6031.616\" data-timecode=\"6031.616\">where I can drag on the screen to paint the petals</span> <span id=\"t=6034.026\" data-timecode=\"6034.026\">on to the tree and they start falling to the ground.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6036.716\" data-timecode=\"6036.716\">There are about 5,000 petals here being physically simulated</span> <span id=\"t=6040.166\" data-timecode=\"6040.166\">and I can interact with them by touching on the screen</span> <span id=\"t=6041.916\" data-timecode=\"6041.916\">to blow wind through the area.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6043.066\" data-timecode=\"6043.066\">All right, next up we have a Koi pond filled</span> <span id=\"t=6048.836\" data-timecode=\"6048.836\">with hundreds of fish.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6050.486\" data-timecode=\"6050.486\">Metal has freed up enough CPU time and we can have each</span> <span id=\"t=6053.186\" data-timecode=\"6053.186\">of them running their own artificial intelligence</span> <span id=\"t=6055.036\" data-timecode=\"6055.036\">which you can see here as I drag around the water.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6056.856\" data-timecode=\"6056.856\">And there's a few more fish here than a real Koi pond</span> <span id=\"t=6059.766\" data-timecode=\"6059.766\">but since Metal lets us do it, we figured why not.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6063.276\" data-timecode=\"6063.276\">And of course every Zen garden needs some sand to rake.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6066.396\" data-timecode=\"6066.396\">So I go over here I can rake any pattern I want</span> <span id=\"t=6069.386\" data-timecode=\"6069.386\">into the sand here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6071.146\" data-timecode=\"6071.146\">Now artist love that they can make an effect like this</span> <span id=\"t=6073.636\" data-timecode=\"6073.636\">without needing a programmer like me to make</span> <span id=\"t=6075.216\" data-timecode=\"6075.216\">that one-off effect for a drop core reduction</span> <span id=\"t=6077.546\" data-timecode=\"6077.546\">or other optimizations.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6082.796\" data-timecode=\"6082.796\">And for our final moment of Zen walk</span> <span id=\"t=6085.286\" data-timecode=\"6085.286\">over to this water fountain.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6088.086\" data-timecode=\"6088.086\">Now I can tap on it, pour out some water which then turns</span> <span id=\"t=6092.196\" data-timecode=\"6092.196\">to a couple hundred butterflies</span> <span id=\"t=6094.126\" data-timecode=\"6094.126\">but of course not going to stop there.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6096.566\" data-timecode=\"6096.566\">So I can touch the screen to call more of them to me</span> <span id=\"t=6098.556\" data-timecode=\"6098.556\">and then guide them around the area.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6099.526\" data-timecode=\"6099.526\">So there are about 3,500 individually animated</span> <span id=\"t=6103.686\" data-timecode=\"6103.686\">and rendered butterfly meshes here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6104.986\" data-timecode=\"6104.986\">Now I had to keep telling the artist to turn the numbers up</span> <span id=\"t=6107.656\" data-timecode=\"6107.656\">and up because they do not think it was going to be possible.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6110.006\" data-timecode=\"6110.006\">Pretty cool huh?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6111.516\" data-timecode=\"6111.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6123.916\" data-timecode=\"6123.916\">Thanks.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6124.836\" data-timecode=\"6124.836\">There are thousands of objects being rendered here and it seem</span> <span id=\"t=6127.136\" data-timecode=\"6127.136\">that we couldn't have dreamed of building prior</span> <span id=\"t=6129.346\" data-timecode=\"6129.346\">to Metal delivering a tenfold increase</span> <span id=\"t=6131.636\" data-timecode=\"6131.636\">in rendering efficiency.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6132.756\" data-timecode=\"6132.756\">To have this level of graphics capability on iPhone</span> <span id=\"t=6136.226\" data-timecode=\"6136.226\">and iPad now is a stunning breakthrough.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6138.896\" data-timecode=\"6138.896\">We're proud to have been a part of it and of course we'd love</span> <span id=\"t=6142.906\" data-timecode=\"6142.906\">to share this with you.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6143.976\" data-timecode=\"6143.976\">So as soon as iOS 8 is available we will be making</span> <span id=\"t=6146.586\" data-timecode=\"6146.586\">that Zen garden available in the app store for free.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6149.846\" data-timecode=\"6149.846\">Thank you.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6151.516\" data-timecode=\"6151.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6160.926\" data-timecode=\"6160.926\">Its amazing and that was it's easy to forget on an iPad.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6165.226\" data-timecode=\"6165.226\">Its incredible graphics they were able to achieve</span> <span id=\"t=6167.326\" data-timecode=\"6167.326\">and I think we are all feeling very Zen now.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6169.546\" data-timecode=\"6169.546\">So that's very good.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6170.776\" data-timecode=\"6170.776\">So that's Metal.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6171.996\" data-timecode=\"6171.996\">Now I want to move from high-end 3D gaming</span> <span id=\"t=6175.206\" data-timecode=\"6175.206\">to casual gaming in Sprite Kit.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6178.136\" data-timecode=\"6178.136\">We introduced Sprite Kit last year at WWDC.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6180.476\" data-timecode=\"6180.476\">And it's been a big hit</span> <span id=\"t=6182.876\" data-timecode=\"6182.876\">with people building casual games on the app store.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6186.196\" data-timecode=\"6186.196\">And now this year we've really enhanced Sprite Kit</span> <span id=\"t=6189.116\" data-timecode=\"6189.116\">with some things that make your casual games just</span> <span id=\"t=6191.346\" data-timecode=\"6191.346\">that much more fun.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6192.766\" data-timecode=\"6192.766\">We have support for light sources, field forces,</span> <span id=\"t=6196.726\" data-timecode=\"6196.726\">per-pixel physics that actually allow your objects</span> <span id=\"t=6199.316\" data-timecode=\"6199.316\">to automatically interact with proper physics based</span> <span id=\"t=6202.006\" data-timecode=\"6202.006\">on their drawn shapes and even inverse kinematics.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6206.346\" data-timecode=\"6206.346\">And now also this year for the first time</span> <span id=\"t=6208.876\" data-timecode=\"6208.876\">on iOS we're bringing SceneKit.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6213.516\" data-timecode=\"6213.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6217.026\" data-timecode=\"6217.026\">Now SceneKit is a 3D scene renderer</span> <span id=\"t=6219.726\" data-timecode=\"6219.726\">and now it's been enhanced as designed for casual games</span> <span id=\"t=6222.506\" data-timecode=\"6222.506\">with an integrated physics engine, particle systems</span> <span id=\"t=6225.726\" data-timecode=\"6225.726\">and support for scripted actions.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6228.466\" data-timecode=\"6228.466\">So these are two great solutions for casual games on iOS.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6232.706\" data-timecode=\"6232.706\">Next, Xcode</span> <span id=\"t=6236.516\" data-timecode=\"6236.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6239.136\" data-timecode=\"6239.136\">Now Xcode is the tool set we use</span> <span id=\"t=6242.196\" data-timecode=\"6242.196\">to build all applications for the Mac and iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6246.686\" data-timecode=\"6246.686\">And Xcode is in fact one</span> <span id=\"t=6248.186\" data-timecode=\"6248.186\">of the most popular pro-apps on our platform.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6251.646\" data-timecode=\"6251.646\">The last version was downloaded 14 million times.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6256.816\" data-timecode=\"6256.816\">It's unbelievable.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6258.456\" data-timecode=\"6258.456\">Now of course central to Xcode is the language we use</span> <span id=\"t=6262.776\" data-timecode=\"6262.776\">to develop our apps, Objective-C.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6266.486\" data-timecode=\"6266.486\">Now Objective-C has served us so well for 20 years.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6270.956\" data-timecode=\"6270.956\">We absolutely love it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6272.146\" data-timecode=\"6272.146\">But we had to ask ourselves the question what would it be</span> <span id=\"t=6275.616\" data-timecode=\"6275.616\">like if we had Objective-C without the baggage of C?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6281.516\" data-timecode=\"6281.516\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6284.126\" data-timecode=\"6284.126\">Well we did more than think about it.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6287.936\" data-timecode=\"6287.936\">We have a new programming language.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6290.516\" data-timecode=\"6290.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6300.856\" data-timecode=\"6300.856\">The language is called Swift and it totally rules [laughter].</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6306.146\" data-timecode=\"6306.146\">Swift is fast.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6307.866\" data-timecode=\"6307.866\">It is modern.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6309.146\" data-timecode=\"6309.146\">It is designed for safety.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6310.656\" data-timecode=\"6310.656\">And it enables the level of interactivity and development</span> <span id=\"t=6313.276\" data-timecode=\"6313.276\">that you've never seen on the platform.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6315.926\" data-timecode=\"6315.926\">When it comes to speed, Swift is great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6319.876\" data-timecode=\"6319.876\">Compare Python a popular scripting language</span> <span id=\"t=6321.916\" data-timecode=\"6321.916\">with Objective-C, when it comes to something like,</span> <span id=\"t=6323.806\" data-timecode=\"6323.806\">let's say complex object sort.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6325.676\" data-timecode=\"6325.676\">Objective-C is a lot faster.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6328.516\" data-timecode=\"6328.516\">But Swift is faster still.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6330.716\" data-timecode=\"6330.716\">And take something like RC4 encryption extremely</span> <span id=\"t=6333.836\" data-timecode=\"6333.836\">computationally intensive.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6336.846\" data-timecode=\"6336.846\">Python gets utterly crushed in this particular benchmark.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6340.096\" data-timecode=\"6340.096\">And Objective but look at Swift.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6344.606\" data-timecode=\"6344.606\">Now Swift is also modern with features like Closures,</span> <span id=\"t=6348.156\" data-timecode=\"6348.156\">Generics, Type inference,</span> <span id=\"t=6349.506\" data-timecode=\"6349.506\">Multiple return types, and Namespaces.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6353.516\" data-timecode=\"6353.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6369.066\" data-timecode=\"6369.066\">You know how many people at home are going,</span> <span id=\"t=6370.416\" data-timecode=\"6370.416\">what the heck are these guys talking about?</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6373.016\" data-timecode=\"6373.016\">[ Laughter ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6374.786\" data-timecode=\"6374.786\">With Swift you're able to reduce a common pattern</span> <span id=\"t=6377.646\" data-timecode=\"6377.646\">that you might see in your Objective-C code like this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6380.406\" data-timecode=\"6380.406\">And reduce it to something as simple as this.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6384.136\" data-timecode=\"6384.136\">And Swift defines away large classes</span> <span id=\"t=6387.676\" data-timecode=\"6387.676\">of common programming errors they just aren't possible.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6392.376\" data-timecode=\"6392.376\">Now, Swift is completely native to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6396.846\" data-timecode=\"6396.846\">It's built with the same LLVM compiler</span> <span id=\"t=6399.626\" data-timecode=\"6399.626\">as Objective-C using the same Optimizer and Autovectorizer.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6403.196\" data-timecode=\"6403.196\">And it has the same ARC memory management model.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6405.926\" data-timecode=\"6405.926\">And the same runtime which means</span> <span id=\"t=6408.346\" data-timecode=\"6408.346\">that your Swift code can fit right alongside your Objective-C</span> <span id=\"t=6413.036\" data-timecode=\"6413.036\">and your C code in the same application.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6416.516\" data-timecode=\"6416.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6425.856\" data-timecode=\"6425.856\">Now Swift also enables a level dynamism and interactivity</span> <span id=\"t=6429.556\" data-timecode=\"6429.556\">in development that we've never seen before</span> <span id=\"t=6431.546\" data-timecode=\"6431.546\">for the feature we call playgrounds.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6434.516\" data-timecode=\"6434.516\">To demonstrate Swift and playgrounds in action,</span> <span id=\"t=6437.926\" data-timecode=\"6437.926\">I'd like to bring to the stage Chris Lattner.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6441.466\" data-timecode=\"6441.466\">Come on up Chris.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6443.516\" data-timecode=\"6443.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6449.366\" data-timecode=\"6449.366\">Thank you Craig.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6450.096\" data-timecode=\"6450.096\">I am thrilled to be here and to be the first person</span> <span id=\"t=6452.846\" data-timecode=\"6452.846\">to give you a taste of Swift.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6455.856\" data-timecode=\"6455.856\">Let me show you how fun</span> <span id=\"t=6456.826\" data-timecode=\"6456.826\">and interactive it is to write Swift code.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6462.936\" data-timecode=\"6462.936\">This is the Swift playground,</span> <span id=\"t=6465.666\" data-timecode=\"6465.666\">as I start typing I get an immediately response.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6469.726\" data-timecode=\"6469.726\">It is actually running my code as I type it</span> <span id=\"t=6472.356\" data-timecode=\"6472.356\">and displaying the result in the sidebar to the right.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6479.356\" data-timecode=\"6479.356\">Of course, Swift user type inference</span> <span id=\"t=6481.526\" data-timecode=\"6481.526\">and has powerful string processing capabilities</span> <span id=\"t=6484.516\" data-timecode=\"6484.516\">which make it as easy to use as a scripting language</span> <span id=\"t=6486.886\" data-timecode=\"6486.886\">without sacrificing any performance.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6490.316\" data-timecode=\"6490.316\">Swift was designed from the ground up for Cocoa</span> <span id=\"t=6493.156\" data-timecode=\"6493.156\">and Cocoa Touch, so of course I have their full power</span> <span id=\"t=6496.506\" data-timecode=\"6496.506\">at my fingertips.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6498.246\" data-timecode=\"6498.246\">Now, I can build anything with Swift</span> <span id=\"t=6501.406\" data-timecode=\"6501.406\">from a social media application all the way</span> <span id=\"t=6503.856\" data-timecode=\"6503.856\">up to a high-performance, 3D game using Metal.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6507.836\" data-timecode=\"6507.836\">But today to keep it simple,</span> <span id=\"t=6509.456\" data-timecode=\"6509.456\">I think I'll write a simple casual 2D game.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6513.856\" data-timecode=\"6513.856\">Let's start by using NSImage.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6517.216\" data-timecode=\"6517.216\">Let's start by using NSImage to load a resource.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6520.976\" data-timecode=\"6520.976\">As you can see here, I've</span> <span id=\"t=6525.666\" data-timecode=\"6525.666\">the playground sees I've loaded an image,</span> <span id=\"t=6527.776\" data-timecode=\"6527.776\">I can ever see it right here from within Xcode.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6532.176\" data-timecode=\"6532.176\">Now, Swift is loaded with high-end features like Generics</span> <span id=\"t=6535.546\" data-timecode=\"6535.546\">that allow me to get a lot done with very little code.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6539.566\" data-timecode=\"6539.566\">Here you can see I'm using an array of strings</span> <span id=\"t=6541.786\" data-timecode=\"6541.786\">and using the functional map algorithm to apply closure</span> <span id=\"t=6545.446\" data-timecode=\"6545.446\">to every element which allows me to load an entire list</span> <span id=\"t=6548.766\" data-timecode=\"6548.766\">of images all with the simple line of code.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6553.506\" data-timecode=\"6553.506\">Now, all these resources of part of this game that I'm working on</span> <span id=\"t=6556.186\" data-timecode=\"6556.186\">and one piece I still need to finish up is the flight path</span> <span id=\"t=6561.106\" data-timecode=\"6561.106\">for the blimp that we have.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6563.946\" data-timecode=\"6563.946\">Now this is a simple loop that computes the position</span> <span id=\"t=6566.926\" data-timecode=\"6566.926\">for the blimp overtime as my game plays.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6570.406\" data-timecode=\"6570.406\">And in addition to seeing individual values Swift</span> <span id=\"t=6574.466\" data-timecode=\"6574.466\">playgrounds even allow me to visualize the entire history</span> <span id=\"t=6577.516\" data-timecode=\"6577.516\">of a value overtime as my application runs.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6581.046\" data-timecode=\"6581.046\">And so now I can immediately see</span> <span id=\"t=6582.696\" data-timecode=\"6582.696\">that this equation will cause my blimp to slowly sink</span> <span id=\"t=6585.916\" data-timecode=\"6585.916\">as the scene plays out.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6588.406\" data-timecode=\"6588.406\">But I think I can do better</span> <span id=\"t=6589.446\" data-timecode=\"6589.446\">and that's not exactly what I'm looking for.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6591.516\" data-timecode=\"6591.516\">So I can change the code and I get an immediate response.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6596.646\" data-timecode=\"6596.646\">Simply by changing the equation the blimp will now rise and fall</span> <span id=\"t=6599.966\" data-timecode=\"6599.966\">as the scene plays out which is a lot more</span> <span id=\"t=6602.016\" data-timecode=\"6602.016\">of what I'm looking for.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6604.196\" data-timecode=\"6604.196\">So, now that we have this the way we want, we can take this</span> <span id=\"t=6606.386\" data-timecode=\"6606.386\">and copy it and let's go to the game that I'm working on.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6610.606\" data-timecode=\"6610.606\">It's right here.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6612.806\" data-timecode=\"6612.806\">Now, this is a playground just like before.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6615.286\" data-timecode=\"6615.286\">But here, I have a game in the code written using Sprite Kit.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6619.526\" data-timecode=\"6619.526\">Now, you can see our blimp going left and right,</span> <span id=\"t=6622.786\" data-timecode=\"6622.786\">straight across the scene.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6624.676\" data-timecode=\"6624.676\">And, I can try out the flight path</span> <span id=\"t=6625.926\" data-timecode=\"6625.926\">that we just developed simply by pasting it in</span> <span id=\"t=6628.956\" data-timecode=\"6628.956\">and getting the immediate feedback I'm looking for.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6631.946\" data-timecode=\"6631.946\">Now, the blimp is rising and falling just like I wanted.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6637.276\" data-timecode=\"6637.276\">Because Swift enables such powerful interactive</span> <span id=\"t=6640.736\" data-timecode=\"6640.736\">and dynamic programming experiences,</span> <span id=\"t=6643.296\" data-timecode=\"6643.296\">it makes it really easy to try out new things.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6646.906\" data-timecode=\"6646.906\">And, just by adding a few lines of code,</span> <span id=\"t=6648.596\" data-timecode=\"6648.596\">I can enable Sprite Kit's per pixel collisions, field forces</span> <span id=\"t=6653.736\" data-timecode=\"6653.736\">and lighting effects gaining a much more interesting result.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6658.796\" data-timecode=\"6658.796\">Now, Swift Playgrounds even give you full power over time.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6662.676\" data-timecode=\"6662.676\">And, with this timeline at the bottom of the screen,</span> <span id=\"t=6667.136\" data-timecode=\"6667.136\">I can go forwards and backwards</span> <span id=\"t=6669.736\" data-timecode=\"6669.736\">through the execution of my game.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6672.366\" data-timecode=\"6672.366\">So, I can really see those effects in action.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6675.086\" data-timecode=\"6675.086\">You can see the balloons interacting with each other</span> <span id=\"t=6677.206\" data-timecode=\"6677.206\">and with the blimp just like that.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6680.636\" data-timecode=\"6680.636\">Playgrounds give me unprecedented power</span> <span id=\"t=6682.976\" data-timecode=\"6682.976\">to see my app in detail and give me full control when I want</span> <span id=\"t=6686.566\" data-timecode=\"6686.566\">to refine and polish my application.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6689.726\" data-timecode=\"6689.726\">But, of course, Swift works great with Xcode</span> <span id=\"t=6692.786\" data-timecode=\"6692.786\">and runs great on iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6694.566\" data-timecode=\"6694.566\">So, let's now jump and see what the finished product looks like.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6703.416\" data-timecode=\"6703.416\">Here we go.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6705.526\" data-timecode=\"6705.526\">And, this is the game that we just built.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6706.916\" data-timecode=\"6706.916\">It looks pretty great.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6709.776\" data-timecode=\"6709.776\">Now, as Craig told you earlier,</span> <span id=\"t=6712.036\" data-timecode=\"6712.036\">we've also brought Scene Kit to iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6714.936\" data-timecode=\"6714.936\">With Scene Kit, it's super easy</span> <span id=\"t=6716.516\" data-timecode=\"6716.516\">to build a 3D version of our game.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6718.766\" data-timecode=\"6718.766\">And, that's just a quick taste and quick look at Swift.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6723.636\" data-timecode=\"6723.636\">I think you guys are going to absolutely love it.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6726.016\" data-timecode=\"6726.016\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6727.706\" data-timecode=\"6727.706\">Thank you very much.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span

data-timecode=\"6738.516\">It gives you access to all of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6741.606\" data-timecode=\"6741.606\">So, you can build everything from a simple example,</span> <span id=\"t=6744.256\" data-timecode=\"6744.256\">like you saw there with Chris,</span> <span id=\"t=6745.686\" data-timecode=\"6745.686\">to the most powerful applications you can imagine.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6749.326\" data-timecode=\"6749.326\">And Swift is going to be ready for primetime out of the gates.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6752.696\" data-timecode=\"6752.696\">It comes with complete Xcode support with indexing,</span> <span id=\"t=6756.396\" data-timecode=\"6756.396\">code completion and debugging.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6758.596\" data-timecode=\"6758.596\">And, there's a Swift language guide available to you now</span> <span id=\"t=6762.396\" data-timecode=\"6762.396\">in iBooks along with complete reference documentation.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6766.506\" data-timecode=\"6766.506\">And, when iOS and OS X are available, day one,</span> <span id=\"t=6771.056\" data-timecode=\"6771.056\">you can submit apps written in Swift to the App Store.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6775.146\" data-timecode=\"6775.146\">That is Swift.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6777.516\" data-timecode=\"6777.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6786.536\" data-timecode=\"6786.536\">So, as you've been able to see,</span> <span id=\"t=6788.176\" data-timecode=\"6788.176\">iOS 8 is a huge developer release</span> <span id=\"t=6791.476\" data-timecode=\"6791.476\">and a great end user release with features</span> <span id=\"t=6794.406\" data-timecode=\"6794.406\">like the new QuickType keyboard, Tap to Talk in Messages, Health,</span> <span id=\"t=6801.546\" data-timecode=\"6801.546\">family sharing and great new photos</span> <span id=\"t=6804.646\" data-timecode=\"6804.646\">with iCloud photo library.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6806.736\" data-timecode=\"6806.736\">But, it's also an unprecedented developer release</span> <span id=\"t=6810.246\" data-timecode=\"6810.246\">with technology like extensions, Metal and Swift.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6816.096\" data-timecode=\"6816.096\">That's iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6817.806\" data-timecode=\"6817.806\">It's going to be available to those of you here in Beta today.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6822.516\" data-timecode=\"6822.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6830.286\" data-timecode=\"6830.286\">And, you guessed it, available to everyone else in the fall</span> <span id=\"t=6834.606\" data-timecode=\"6834.606\">and it will run on all of these devices.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6837.476\" data-timecode=\"6837.476\">That is iOS 8.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6838.546\" data-timecode=\"6838.546\">Thank you.</span> </p>\n<p class=\"annotation\"><span id=\"t=6840.516\" data-timecode=\"6840.516\">[ Applause ]</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6844.076\" data-timecode=\"6844.076\">Great job.</span> </p>\n<p

id=\"t=6853.886\" data-timecode=\"6853.886\">and an incredible release.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6856.046\" data-timecode=\"6856.046\">It's been a fun morning.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6857.166\" data-timecode=\"6857.166\">You can probably see that from us.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6858.356\" data-timecode=\"6858.356\">I hope you've enjoyed it as well.</span> </p>\n<p

id=\"t=6864.916\" data-timecode=\"6864.916\">This morning, you've seen Yosemite, the future of OS X</span> <span id=\"t=6870.456\" data-timecode=\"6870.456\">with an incredible new design, amazing new features</span> <span id=\"t=6875.606\" data-timecode=\"6875.606\">and engineered to work seamlessly with iOS.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6879.496\" data-timecode=\"6879.496\">You've seen iOS 8, the biggest release of iOS</span> <span id=\"t=6884.586\" data-timecode=\"6884.586\">since the introduction of the App Store.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6887.486\" data-timecode=\"6887.486\">It's huge for developers and massive for everyone else.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6892.736\" data-timecode=\"6892.736\">And perhaps, more importantly,</span> <span id=\"t=6895.586\" data-timecode=\"6895.586\">you've seen how our operating systems, devices</span> <span id=\"t=6900.256\" data-timecode=\"6900.256\">and services all work together in harmony.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6904.546\" data-timecode=\"6904.546\">Together, they provide an integrated</span> <span id=\"t=6908.656\" data-timecode=\"6908.656\">and continuous experience across all of our products.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6915.356\" data-timecode=\"6915.356\">And, you've seen how developers can extend their experience</span> <span id=\"t=6919.966\" data-timecode=\"6919.966\">further than they've ever done before</span> <span id=\"t=6923.026\" data-timecode=\"6923.026\">and how they can create powerful apps even faster and more easily</span> <span id=\"t=6928.266\" data-timecode=\"6928.266\">than they've ever been able to.</span> </p>\n<p><span id=\"t=6933.246\" data-timecode=\"6933.246\">Apple engineers platforms, devices and services together,</span> <span
